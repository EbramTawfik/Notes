### Question 1:


**[True or False]**  
The Kalman gain is calculated in the prediction step of the Kalman filter.

#### **Answer:** False



#### **Explanation & Steps:**


- The **Kalman gain** is calculated in the **update step**, not in the prediction step.


- **Prediction step**: The filter predicts the next state and the associated uncertainty (covariance).


- **Update step**: After receiving a measurement, the Kalman gain is computed to determine how much weight to give to the prediction versus the measurement. The Kalman gain is then used to correct the state estimate.

### Question 2:


Consider a robot whose state $\bar{x}$ is its $(x, y)$ position. If it starts at state $\bar{x}_0 = [4, 7]^T$ at time $t=0$ and moves according to the state transition model $F = \begin{bmatrix} 0.7 & 0.3 \\ 0.1 & 0.5 \end{bmatrix}$, what is the $y$-component of its predicted state, $\bar{x}_1$, at time $t = 1$? (Specify to 1 decimal place.)

#### **Answer:** 3.9



#### **Steps:**


1. The initial state $\bar{x}_0 = [4, 7]^T$ gives us $x_0 = 4$ and $y_0 = 7$.
2. The state transition model $F = \begin{bmatrix} 0.7 & 0.3 \\ 0.1 & 0.5 \end{bmatrix}$.
3. To predict the next state $\bar{x}_1$, use the equation $\bar{x}_1 = F \cdot \bar{x}_0$:
   

$$
\begin{bmatrix} 0.7 & 0.3 \\ 0.1 & 0.5 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 4.9 \\ 3.9 \end{bmatrix}
$$


4. The $y$-component of the predicted state is **3.9**.

### Question 3:


**[True or False]**  
In GraphSLAM, landmarks must be distinguishable from one another.

#### **Answer:** True



#### **Explanation & Steps:**


- **GraphSLAM** stands for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping using graph-based techniques.


- In order for the robot to correctly associate sensor measurements to map landmarks, the landmarks must be **distinct**.


- If landmarks are not distinguishable, the robot may confuse one landmark for another, causing errors in both the map and its location estimate.

### Question 4:


For each equation below, determine whether the equation is part of the **measurement update step** or the **prediction step** of a Kalman Filter. If the equation is not part of either step, select "Other."

(A) $P' = (I - KH) P$  
(B) $y_i = y_i + \alpha(x_i - y_i) + \beta(y_{i-1} - 2y_i + y_{i+1})$  
(C) $P' = F P F^T$  
(D) $x' = x + K(z - Hx)$  
(E) $K = P H^T (H P H^T + R)^{-1}$  
(F) $x' = Fx + u$

#### **Answer & Steps:**


- **Equation A**: **Measurement update step**  


   - $P' = (I - KH) P$ is part of the **measurement update step**. It represents the update of the covariance matrix after incorporating the measurement.

- **Equation B**: **Other**  


   - This equation is unrelated to the Kalman filter and likely comes from a different type of system.

- **Equation C**: **Prediction step**  


   - $P' = F P F^T$ is part of the **prediction step**, where the covariance is predicted based on the system model.

- **Equation D**: **Measurement update step**  


   - $x' = x + K(z - Hx)$ is part of the **measurement update step**. This equation represents the state update after incorporating the measurement.

- **Equation E**: **Measurement update step**  


   - $K = P H^T (H P H^T + R)^{-1}$ is part of the **measurement update step**. This equation calculates the Kalman gain.

- **Equation F**: **Prediction step**  


   - $x' = Fx + u$ is part of the **prediction step**, where the state is predicted based on the system's dynamics.

### Question 5:


**[True or False]**  
According to Sebastian, the localization problem is to determine a robot's location ____.

- within a certain level of accuracy


- given no prior map of the world


- without using another positioning system such as GPS



#### **Answer:** within a certain level of accuracy



#### **Explanation & Steps:**


- Localization involves estimating the robot's position within a known environment with a specific **level of accuracy**.


- In robotics, this is often done using various sensors and algorithms such as Kalman filters or SLAM techniques to refine the location estimate while considering noise and uncertainties.

### Question 6:


Assume we have two Gaussian distributions G1 and G2. G1 has a large variance and G2 has a small variance. G1 represents the prior, and G2 represents the measurement probability. Suppose we combine these Gaussians in order to obtain an updated state estimate. Where would the center of the resulting distribution most likely be located?

- closer to G1


- closer to G2


- in the middle of G1 and G2


- not enough information



#### **Answer:** closer to G2



#### **Explanation & Steps:**


- **G1** has a large variance (more uncertainty), while **G2** has a small variance (less uncertainty).


- When combining the two distributions, the final estimate will be **weighted** by the inverse of the variances.


- Since **G2** has smaller variance (higher confidence), the resulting distribution will be **closer to G2**.

### Question 7:


**[True or False]**  
In SLAM, the probability distribution representing the final robot location after a sequence of noisy movements can be calculated by adding together the individual distributions representing each movement.

#### **Answer:** False



#### **Explanation & Steps:**


- In **SLAM**, the probability distributions are not simply added; instead, they are **convolved** with each other.


- This convolution



process considers the uncertainty from each step, updating the overall probability distribution by combining the effects of each movement. This is essential for incorporating the noise and uncertainty in the robot's motion model.

### Question 8:


The Kalman gain is the weight applied to the measurements and ______________ when updating the state.

- prior probability


- correlation coefficient


- predicted state


- Gaussian distribution



#### **Answer:** predicted state



#### **Explanation & Steps:**


- The **Kalman gain** is used to combine the **predicted state** and the new **measurement** to update the state estimate.


- The Kalman gain decides how much influence the measurement will have compared to the prediction when determining the final estimate.


- The updated state is a weighted combination of the predicted state and the measurement, where the Kalman gain governs this balance.

### Question 9:


The weight associated with a particle is calculated from:

- The probability of the particle state matching the robot's state given the measurement


- The probability of the observed measurements given the state of the particle


- The Euclidean distance from the particle to the robot


- The squared error of the measurement



#### **Answer:** The probability of the observed measurements given the state of the particle



#### **Explanation & Steps:**


- In **particle filters**, each particle is assigned a weight based on how well its state explains the observed measurements.


- This weight is proportional to the **likelihood** of the measurement given the particleâ€™s state.


- The higher the probability that a particle's state matches the observed measurement, the higher its weight.



---

### Question 10:


**[True or False]**  
The particle with the highest weight is always sampled.

#### **Answer:** False



#### **Explanation & Steps:**


- In a **particle filter**, the particles are sampled based on their weights using a **probabilistic resampling** method.


- While particles with higher weights are more **likely** to be sampled, it is not guaranteed that the particle with the highest weight will always be selected.


- This probabilistic approach ensures diversity in the particle set, preventing the filter from collapsing onto a potentially incorrect state.
