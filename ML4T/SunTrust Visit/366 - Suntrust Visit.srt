1
00:00:32,280 --> 00:01:00,980
So, thank you very much, everyone, for joining us today.

2
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,370
We're going to get started now.

3
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,600
Hello there in TV land.

4
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:33,200
We have our online members also participating.

5
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:42,540
Today is a special day I try each semester at least once to

6
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:49,020
have professionals who actually apply machine learning and

7
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,940
AI in finance come and speak to us.

8
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:59,860
Today we're fortunate to have a team from some trust who is

9
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,920
a hit for you today.

10
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,240
Here in Atlanta,

11
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,560
you can tell us some of the things they do with finance

12
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,360
using some of the same tools right here.

13
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,060
Also be advised that they are looking too higher,

14
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,380
potentially both full -time folks and interns.

15
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,380
So pay attention, take down their email addresses.

16
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,960
During the presentations,

17
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,700
they've said that they're willing to answer questions along

18
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:32,980
the way.

19
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,920
So if you have a question, please raise your hand and ask.

20
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,040
One thing for some trustees,

21
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:44,180
repeat the question because the people online aren't

22
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,520
necessarily going to have heard it.

23
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,080
So repeat it.

24
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,040
Also,

25
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,020
sometimes someone's up front with people in the back here,

26
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:52,900
so we'll get to questions.

27
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:53,760
Anyways,

28
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,600
let me start off by inviting Bob Papowski to come out then

29
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,820
and give us an overview of the questions.

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,940
We're going to hear from some So good afternoon,

31
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,140
my name is Bob.

32
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,440
I'll see what I do within Subtrust is I'm responsible for

33
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,880
sales creating research and the investment bank So when you

34
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,340
think about the investment process,

35
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,520
we'll talk a little bit about that today.

36
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,760
We help facilitate investors investing in securities right

37
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,580
and how we apply Machine learning AI algorithms and tools

38
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,840
is a little bit of a different version of what and how

39
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,520
traditional investments Magic company edge funding Along

40
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,160
with me.

41
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,980
I have Jeff Hughes who's responsible for equity research

42
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,400
I'll talk briefly about three things that we're doing

43
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,260
thinking about doing he'll be talking about one of those

44
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,540
three things As well we have I'm in the spot of the

45
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:01,700
emergency who's responsible for data and analytics AI

46
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,000
machine learning within the consumer bank and we have John

47
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,840
who is responsible for Risk in analytics with this event

48
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,300
itself And so I'll briefly touch on three things and I'll

49
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:13,980
pass it off.

50
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:18,079
So feel free to interrupt me with questions along the way

51
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,240
Three main bodies of work exist within investment banks at

52
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,460
the moment including Subtrust for office and how free first

53
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:29,660
is trade identification Okay So if you think about what a

54
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,140
dealer is a dealer is a market maker who is trying to buy

55
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,080
and sell securities Some of them they own some of them.

56
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,340
They don't know Some of these markets are not people So if

57
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,520
you come to me and you ask me to buy a specific security

58
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,400
that I do not own It would be really useful for me as a

59
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,480
salesperson or as a trader to quickly identify something

60
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,840
that has similar characteristics that make the needs fit

61
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,800
the needs of the client Machine learning and analytics will

62
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,300
be able to and do analyze behaviors individuals at

63
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,260
companies of companies themselves and the predictive

64
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,320
analytics that we can deploy to determine whether or not a

65
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,860
transaction is a suitable fit could in fact make a

66
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,040
transaction happen between us at the investment bank and

67
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,340
that client as opposed to calling another investment bank

68
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,120
away from us.

69
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,820
The trade identification is a big and important deal that's

70
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,440
fairly new.

71
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,140
If you think about it,

72
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,460
it's kind of what Amazon does in a different application.

73
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,420
Trade execution.

74
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,200
The traditionally trade execution within investment bank in

75
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,680
the sales and trading groups has been identified through,

76
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,760
identified factors that could be quickly analyzed to

77
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,640
produce a price with or without human intervention.

78
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,600
That's been around for a long time.

79
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,920
What's changing is the analytical power that's available

80
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,040
through cloud computing and other computing services that

81
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,680
allow for the machines to start to learn how to enhance the

82
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,740
algorithms independently of human intervention.

83
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,900
Trade algorithms that start to use machine learning to

84
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,860
determine and optimize the business model itself.

85
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,380
Lastly, research.

86
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,160
A large part of what investment banks do,

87
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,840
and we're no different,

88
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,600
is spend a lot of time analyzing companies,

89
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,200
analyzing markets.

90
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,220
And in order to do that,

91
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,180
we need a data science program behind you that supports all

92
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,620
three disciplines I just talked about.

93
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,240
And we are embarking on a data science project,

94
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,020
which Jeff will talk about.

95
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,360
What I would say, more broadly speaking, having grown up,

96
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,620
I was originally a science major and then changed to

97
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:41,920
finance.

98
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,600
I wish I stayed in science because the market is coming

99
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,080
your way.

100
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,560
A lot of what we're going to be working on,

101
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:51,240
and I believe a lot of the future leaders of not only STRH,

102
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,460
but broadly speaking,

103
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,560
investment banks are going to have your backgrounds.

104
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,440
So the more you can focus on programming and understanding

105
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:58,940
finance,

106
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,900
the more applicable you're going to be to how we're trying

107
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,760
to develop our company and how the market is trying to

108
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,580
recruit talent as well.

109
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,460
So I won't answer any questions throughout the day,

110
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,220
but I don't want to take Jeff's time,

111
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,260
so I'll pass it off to Jeff so he can talk a little bit

112
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,680
more about data science as it relates to equity research.

113
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,840
Good afternoon, everyone.

114
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,460
It's a pleasure to be on Georgia Tech's campus.

115
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,680
You definitely sent us the Vibrantee back room.

116
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,580
It's great to be here at campus.

117
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,080
As Bob mentioned, my name is Jeff Utes.

118
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,960
I run equity research at SunTrust Roberts and Humphrey.

119
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,920
Quick background before I get into talking about how we and

120
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,520
the sell side is using data analytics to provide value,

121
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,900
add value to the buy side.

122
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,660
I've been at SunTrust Roberts and Humphrey for five years.

123
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,300
I've been director of equity research in that capacity.

124
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,540
Before joining SunTrust Roberts and Humphrey,

125
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,620
I spent 15 years.

126
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,880
at a global investment bank,

127
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,060
spending time in New York as well as Chicago.

128
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:06,560
Before that,

129
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,100
I received my MBA at the Fuqua School of Business at Duke.

130
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,460
And before that,

131
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,360
I spent seven years in corporate banking in Chicago,

132
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,100
and I received my undergrad at the University of Notre

133
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:17,360
Dame.

134
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:22,180
As Bob mentioned, I think 20 years from now,

135
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,600
maybe even 10 years from now, maybe seven years from now,

136
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,300
the background of the Directors of Equity Research will

137
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,160
have backgrounds like yours, not mine.

138
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,200
So this is very relevant, I think,

139
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:35,559
and the opportunities in this career for folks with your

140
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,640
background are significant and substantial.

141
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,900
Before I get started on talking a little bit about

142
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,799
analytics,

143
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,800
I wanna just give everyone a little background on our

144
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,140
industry, the securities industry.

145
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,520
And there are a lot of terms that are thrown around,

146
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,460
buy side, sell side, issuers,

147
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,440
and I just wanna make sure that everyone understands some

148
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,180
of the basics here.

149
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,940
On the sell side, we're talking about broker dealers,

150
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,280
the investment thing, some trust around some people.

151
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,320
Other firms you've probably heard of, Golden Tax,

152
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,620
Morgan Stanley, Geeky.

153
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,720
We're sell -siders and we provide information and trading

154
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,660
execution to our clients on the buy side.

155
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:14,940
So on the buy side,

156
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,720
that's institutional investors that are clients of ours,

157
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,180
and that includes long -only complexes,

158
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,480
asset management complexes like American Century,

159
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,000
Waddell and Reed, Wellington Fidelity,

160
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,760
names you're probably familiar with.

161
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,680
Also includes increasingly hedge funds,

162
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:38,040
number of names you're probably familiar with,

163
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,540
Citadelle Surveyor, Bridgewater for example,

164
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,420
Braidale was on TFC this morning, but we bought that.

165
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,620
And also pension funds and endowment funds that are

166
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,080
considered institutional investors on the buy side.

167
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,840
And then lastly, issuers,

168
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,780
they're publicly traded companies that we might cover.

169
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,600
There are about 3 ,700

170
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,700
publicly traded companies on US stock exchanges right now.

171
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:09,820
Moving on, what is a sell side analyst do?

172
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,240
In our research department,

173
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:17,120
we have about 100 teammates and about 40 publishing equity

174
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,420
research analysts covering a variety of industries,

175
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,960
from TMT to financials to consumer to industrials to

176
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,440
energy, you name it, they cover verticals, sub -verticals,

177
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:28,860
etc.

178
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,220
They really wear a number of different hats.

179
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,700
One is consultants,

180
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,960
serve as an industry expert on typically 10 to 30 companies

181
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,560
that are coverage.

182
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,600
That's Santhras Robinson, Humphrey,

183
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,700
our 40 analysts on average cover about 20 stocks.

184
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,140
And they serve as really portfolio consultants to our

185
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,400
clients on the buy side.

186
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,280
They provide information to clients to help them make

187
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,640
better investment decisions.

188
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,000
They also serve as financial analysts.

189
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,660
They build multi -year forecasts.

190
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,720
establish earnings estimates, sales estimates,

191
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,580
and those can be extremely helpful to the buy side.

192
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,480
We'll also do fundamental channel check research which is

193
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,540
extremely important.

194
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,060
The job is really to change pretty dramatically from being

195
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:20,140
a reporter of earnings previews and reviews to really doing

196
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,560
more value added work now.

197
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,560
Our research analysts are on the road an awful lot.

198
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,060
They spend a lot of time doing proprietary research,

199
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,940
attending conferences, also taking up our companies,

200
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,960
the companies that we cover on the road to see

201
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,280
institutional investors as well.

202
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,200
So, the job is changing, I referenced that earlier.

203
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,860
The job of a research analyst used to be focused on

204
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,000
publishing earnings previews and earnings recaps and that's

205
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,840
really become commoditized.

206
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:55,080
The real value added now is coming up of quantitative

207
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,900
differentiated proprietary work that the buy side will pay

208
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,120
for.

209
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,840
Increasing the buy side wallpaper and recaps because

210
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,460
there's very little value at You can see on this graph here

211
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:11,140
that the amount of money that our clients are spending on

212
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:15,320
data has been growing Astronomically 168 million on data

213
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,220
just two years ago 400 million this year and the outlook

214
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:24,280
for data spending going forward is very robust When we talk

215
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:28,680
about Alternative data want to make sure everyone's kind of

216
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,460
clear on this how was it and how the buy side is using it

217
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,180
Generally to find alternative data is independent data.

218
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,680
It does not come directly from the companies that we cover

219
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,820
It basically is information that helps the buy side

220
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,420
understand the insights on the income statement

221
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,320
Specifically revenues as well as margins are coming up with

222
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,300
earnings for share estimates And there are all kinds of

223
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:55,620
alternative data as I've spelled out here You know some of

224
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,980
the data is is stuff You're probably familiar with credit

225
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:03,100
card data satellite imaging and social media data online

226
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:07,320
product reviews search patterns on popular word searches

227
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,900
And you'll see in the bottom pie graph there alternate the

228
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:15,660
data is Some alternate data is considered more accurate

229
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,580
than others specifically credit card data is very valuable

230
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:27,040
information as is web scraping data So how are How is data

231
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,120
analytics used in the research process really two ways

232
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,800
number one is is data management and the second and second?

233
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:37,620
Item is advanced analytics Data management you have to

234
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,720
obtain the data first Extract it it comes from you come

235
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,000
from labor intensive Web scraping or you can buy the data

236
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,680
from third -party data providers The second thing your data

237
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,600
cleansing very very important,

238
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,260
and this is probably the most difficult most value -added

239
00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:00,240
element here on this page most of the reason for that is

240
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,160
most of the data,

241
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,120
many experts say that the data is really not usable.

242
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,340
And why is that?

243
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,940
You might have time series that are wrong,

244
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,580
you might have differing years of data, you know,

245
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,520
questions about can you normalize the data,

246
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,960
can you back test the data,

247
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,440
can you use some statistical tools to assess if the data is

248
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,040
good or bad.

249
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,640
That's very, very important.

250
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,960
And the buy side and the sell side spend a lot of time to

251
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,060
try to clean the data.

252
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,040
Once you clean the data, you know,

253
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,720
the next part is making the data presentable.

254
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,400
And then a number of tools are used,

255
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:40,360
advanced analytics are used to test, to run hypotheses.

256
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,220
You've got scenario analysis and simulation,

257
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,180
correlation analysis that's used,

258
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,980
and machine learning for pattern recognition,

259
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,580
regression analysis, etc.

260
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:58,400
Now the next slide here shows the big picture how we use

261
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,100
data analytics.

262
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,160
We use it to improve the quality of our research to focus

263
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,160
more on Higher value add work such as deep dive thematic

264
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,300
pieces differentiate real research But moving away from

265
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,540
what I described earlier as the commoditized research

266
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:11,900
product,

267
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:16,060
which is just reporting and is not valued by Our clients on

268
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:16,660
the buy side.

269
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,800
We also use it as a tool to help us be more efficient That

270
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:27,020
allows us to cover more stocks and Lastly to become more

271
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,560
client -centric as I mentioned earlier.

272
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,720
There's a lot more money being spent the data by the buy

273
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,180
side essentially every type of client whether you're a

274
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:38,180
small cap manager or a large cap manager or a long only

275
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,440
Asset manager with a three -year plus time horizon or a

276
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,420
hedge fund with a two -week time horizon you want more data

277
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,060
Here's some examples on the next few slides.

278
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,880
I've got some examples of of Analytics and specific

279
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,340
verticals that we'll talk about I'm not going to go through

280
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:01,440
every single one of these But you can take a look at these

281
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,600
online and and see some of the applications of how they're

282
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,060
used within consumer Space we have an analyst right now

283
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,220
covers cruise lines,

284
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:15,600
and he scrapes cruise line data From websites from either

285
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,660
travel agency websites or directly from the cruise lines

286
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,640
And he finds changes in pricing to be very effective in

287
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:29,760
understanding the trends in top line That's been very well

288
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,600
received By the buy side.

289
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,440
They're also analysts on the street who check inventory

290
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:41,220
Some websites like AutoNation or Carvana We'll check them

291
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,480
on a weekly basis and look at the SKUs and vehicle

292
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:48,180
identification numbers to identify How a product is moving

293
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:52,220
it as quickly as the discounted aggressively etc And that

294
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,800
can be very helpful with regard to identifying your term

295
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:00,300
trends Also on social media media sites, we use,

296
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,600
there are folks that use a lot of tools to quantify reviews

297
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,980
on social media sites,

298
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,160
and that can be very valuable as well.

299
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:10,819
Other verticals in healthcare,

300
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,780
you look at trends in advertising and the correlation

301
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,119
between drug spending to come up with sales projections.

302
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,180
Also, currently approved drugs and non -approved drugs,

303
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,540
looking at comparative profiles, product descriptions,

304
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,680
and the related companies to try to formulate what the top

305
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,220
line might look like and if it mirrors a competitive

306
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:32,720
product,

307
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,760
to come up with kind of peak revenue and sustainable

308
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,100
revenues going forward.

309
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,500
Also, within the EMT vertical,

310
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,340
there's a lot of technology tools that are being used.

311
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,020
I mentioned earlier, scraping pricing data,

312
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,800
and you can see a couple examples there cited.

313
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,640
Google Trends, search word analysis,

314
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,460
a lot of reviews on websites, etc.

315
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,780
And then oil and gas is another energy sector.

316
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:03,620
There's a lot of analytical tools that are used to scrape

317
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,680
data, to find alternative data,

318
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,380
and come up with unique insights.

319
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,840
So how are we currently using data and analytics,

320
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,660
and how will we use it in the future?

321
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,420
We have a retail,

322
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,400
it's real estate investment trust analyst,

323
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,600
named Keevan Kim.

324
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:22,620
And Keevan puts out a quarterly piece about the key to self

325
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:22,940
-storage.

326
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,440
He covers a number of publicly traded self -storage

327
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,280
companies and his read companies.

328
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:32,060
And he goes through 300 self -storage units in order to

329
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,820
come up with pricing trends and promotion.

330
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,160
This has been very predictive with regard to understanding

331
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,600
near -term trends.

332
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,980
And it's basically must reading for anyone that is us in

333
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,480
self -storage space right now, Keevan Kim's work.

334
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,820
Our restaurant analyst, Jake Bartlett,

335
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,600
manually reviews pricing items on a number of websites.

336
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,360
The fast, casual, and casual restaurant space,

337
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,240
such as like a Tardons or David Busters,

338
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,580
coming up with unique insights on pricing that's been very

339
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,940
valuable to the buy side.

340
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,440
Our leisure analyst,

341
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,240
who covers theme parks and golf manufacturing equipment,

342
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,980
as well as boat manufacturers.

343
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:21,320
Mike Schwartz does proprietary work on understanding the

344
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:25,360
monthly, how new product especially is tracking.

345
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,120
And we use a lot of data analytics to come up with some

346
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,760
identified trends in pricing and on the top line.

347
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:32,980
In the future,

348
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,000
we wanna use some tools to help us and a couple other

349
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,780
verticals, specifically energy, as well as aerospace.

350
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,940
There are a number of government websites that we can

351
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,200
access and use some tools to help us accumulate data on.

352
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,780
For example, on a county basis, how wells are,

353
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,980
the productivity on certain wells in certain counties in

354
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,660
the state of Texas.

355
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,280
And same thing with aerospace and defense.

356
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,500
data points from government websites.

357
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,300
There's a current use example that's pretty neat.

358
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,380
About three or four months ago our internet analyst,

359
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,040
Yusuf Scully,

360
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,720
came out with a report really focusing on Amazon and

361
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,060
specifically their private label business clothing

362
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:15,760
specifically.

363
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,120
We looked at SKUs offered by Amazon as well as competitive

364
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,800
brands from Calvin and clients and other competitors and

365
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,600
looked at pricing data on each brand.

366
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,220
What Yusuf concluded is that Amazon's private label brands

367
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:32,820
have tremendous opportunity to continue to gain share based

368
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:36,620
on customer use and the Amazon private label brand versus

369
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,980
other competing brands.

370
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,980
This is going to be a source of upside we think for Amazon

371
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,460
in the near term and longer term.

372
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,900
It's been a great call.

373
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,640
We got a lot of publicity on this one.

374
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,620
It was highlighted in the New York Times Sunday edition on

375
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:53,260
June 24th and Amazon stocks up about 15% since we published

376
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:53,780
this data.

377
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,900
It was one of our most widely pieces of research for the

378
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,420
last year.

379
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,040
So, in conclusion,

380
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,800
the times are really changing in equity research on the buy

381
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,600
side as well as the sell side.

382
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,960
The days of sell side research analysts relying on

383
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,880
quarterly previews and reviews to do primary research,

384
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,620
the buy side just won't pay for that anymore.

385
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,860
The buy side is demanding more proprietary, creative,

386
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,880
and quantitative research from the sell side.

387
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,000
And technology advancements are creating a tremendous

388
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,520
amount of opportunity here for us to have value to look up

389
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,960
the key proprietary insights to offer the buy side.

390
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,800
The Holy Grail is taking the expertise,

391
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:41,080
the experience of our analysts combined with the technology

392
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,100
tools that are in place right now and are continuing to

393
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:44,520
evolve.

394
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,780
The power of the data as well as the combining with the

395
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,800
intellectual capabilities of our analysts is really where

396
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,280
the Holy Grail is with regards to how the buy side is using

397
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,060
sell side research going forward.

398
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,360
And with that, I'm happy to take any questions.

399
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,080
One over there.

400
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:06,900
Sir?

401
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,180
I was wondering about the process.

402
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:14,840
How you look at a given company in this sector and

403
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,900
determining in the end which kind of data sources are

404
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,760
relevant for making any valuable predictions if there's

405
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,260
like it's more of a scientific process or it's more of a

406
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,040
hard question.

407
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,740
So the question is, when we come up with,

408
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,180
when you're looking at companies,

409
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,680
how do we assess what data sources that will be valuable?

410
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,220
Is that kind of the gist of the question?

411
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,260
So that's a very good question.

412
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,060
And it really comes up, it comes down to,

413
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,240
our analysts all have quite a bit of experience in our

414
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,120
industry experts understanding what the key drivers are

415
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,880
with regard to the top one I mentioned.

416
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,320
The impact on the business model.

417
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,900
And a lot of it is just having an understanding,

418
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:00,400
being an industry expert and understanding what will drive

419
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,160
those key variables.

420
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,320
Give me an example.

421
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:12,400
There are some third party data providers who will give you

422
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,500
parking lot data.

423
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:18,640
So if you have a consumer analyst who covers Home Depot or

424
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,500
Lowe's, for example, Home Depot or company,

425
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,960
there are entities out there that will provide parking lot

426
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,340
data, satellite feeds,

427
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:31,240
to give you an understanding of how busy the parking lot

428
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,900
is, specifically on weekends,

429
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:37,600
because that's when the majority of sales occurs for these

430
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,140
two companies.

431
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,420
And you can have a greater understanding of the weather

432
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,480
impact, for example.

433
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,180
There's been particularly dismal weather in the spring that

434
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:50,740
can have an adverse impact on traffic for Home Depot,

435
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,480
specifically in the garden.

436
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,780
Area Home Depot and that that can really drive your term.

437
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,580
It's all true at Home Depot or less.

438
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,760
That's one example It's you know,

439
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,120
it's really having an understanding of what's driving the

440
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,820
underlying metrics that are most important Might be the

441
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:13,180
same store sales comps in a retail Environment might be

442
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:13,900
foot traffic.

443
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:19,540
It really depends on specific industry specific company I

444
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:23,700
don't please what I might say is on top of that.

445
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,680
So I think the answer is it can be both We're starting to

446
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,720
develop on the thesis.

447
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,580
It can be both that You know,

448
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,540
we want the expertise of fundamental analysts tell us that

449
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:39,020
think are interesting and then we try to find better ways

450
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:42,800
to access data or more unique data sets that maybe you a

451
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,360
couple layers below that but then there's also the

452
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,980
discipline of Finding unique data sets and patterns things

453
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:53,640
that we didn't think were correlated to a particular stock

454
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,380
Right,

455
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,820
and that's the initiative that we're starting to kick off

456
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:01,800
in 2019 so I think you can approach it from a data science

457
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,660
perspective and that can inform An equity fundamental

458
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:08,540
research analyst and then you can take equity fundamental

459
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:13,020
research and you can find better You know patterns and and

460
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:17,020
data sets Around the things they care about right a lot of

461
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:21,080
firms are setting up firms being investment banks Setting

462
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,800
up subsidiaries around the thesis that you can create

463
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:28,220
unique data sets They go into the revenue graph that Jeff

464
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:32,140
showed early But I think that's probably a fair assessment

465
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:36,800
of the capacity to both empower the 40 analysts that we

466
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,820
have But also create a new discipline and a new product

467
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:48,900
that could be sold into the buy side as well I Didn't mean

468
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:54,220
to take precedence over sorry well imagine a fresh Georgia

469
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,840
Tech graduate completes this course,

470
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,700
starts work at SunTrust.

471
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,240
Where would you imagine they would plug in here?

472
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:03,900
So for instance,

473
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:10,120
would they be paired with an analyst and do studies for

474
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:10,360
them?

475
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,940
Would they be an analyst?

476
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,960
How does that work?

477
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,600
The answer to that question is because there's plenty of

478
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,980
opportunities at SunTrust.

479
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,760
Rob is now free.

480
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:19,880
Yes,

481
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,940
you could come in and work with one of our industry experts.

482
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:29,000
But Bob referenced a new investment that SunTrust,

483
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:32,560
Rob is making in data analytics and data science.

484
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,280
We were building a data science team.

485
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,200
We're in the process of trying to hire a data scientist

486
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:38,880
right now.

487
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,200
And then we'll be building a team around that person.

488
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,560
So there would be great opportunities there to come in and

489
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,380
work with our data scientists who are interviewing folks

490
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,640
right now, actually, for that senior level position.

491
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,600
So there's plenty of opportunities.

492
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,520
And I truly do believe that 10 years from now,

493
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,700
12 years from now,

494
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,580
next DOR will have some quantitative experience.

495
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,380
So I keep them all out.

496
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:01,760
Question in the back.

497
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:02,700
Thank you.

498
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:07,340
What data makes you very all using to store your data?

499
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,580
Are you using something centralized?

500
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,080
Second,

501
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,680
specific tools you are using for advanced analytics,

502
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,660
specific languages you like to play in,

503
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,620
visualization packages.

504
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,380
And third is,

505
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,880
how big is the centrist profits and Humphrey doing right

506
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,140
now?

507
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,400
How big is centrist?

508
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,400
Robinson Humphrey, specific.

509
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:26,380
OK, sure.

510
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,320
So the question is, what data sets are we using right now?

511
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,760
Pardon me?

512
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,520
Data bases.

513
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:33,660
Data bases.

514
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,920
What kind of analytical tools are we using right now?

515
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,360
And then the size of centrist Robinson Humphrey.

516
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,380
Let me start with the last one,

517
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,800
which is the easiest for someone who doesn't have a lot of

518
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,160
background.

519
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:50,480
Some trust Robinson Humphrey is about $2 billion in

520
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,700
revenues, roughly, right?

521
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,300
Our investment bank, the investment bank,

522
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,280
subsidiary of some trust bank.

523
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,940
The bottom line, probably, if you want to keep it.

524
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:03,420
So the investment bank is about 1 ,160 people.

525
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,520
Sales and trading is about 360 of that.

526
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,300
Every research is about 100 of that.

527
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,760
The data analytics team I have is about seven people.

528
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:14,180
At the moment, that's going to continue to work, right?

529
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,100
It's a fairly new initiative for us.

530
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,500
There are a few databases.

531
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,840
One is centrally owned.

532
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,460
The nice thing about being associated with bank,

533
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,000
and we have two other colleagues who come up and speak,

534
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:28,100
is that there's a lot of infrastructure that's available in

535
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:28,780
shared services.

536
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,260
So there's a data lake that's available for big data.

537
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:35,220
And analytics around the data lake, we haven't called out.

538
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:39,820
There's a recent initiative that was stood up within some

539
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,800
trust bank itself.

540
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:45,460
And so I get built for free in life,

541
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,440
but I have the ability to access tools.

542
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,420
Primarily, every research analyst and journalist people,

543
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,840
the QCF folks that we have.

544
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,900
most of them have actually come from this college,

545
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,700
are folks on Python and ARP, and analytics around it.

546
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:02,560
But we're in very early stages, as Jeff mentioned,

547
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,400
building out a data science team.

548
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:07,740
I think that's, to me, an exciting thing, right?

549
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,160
A lot of opportunity is available when you're starting

550
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,320
something new around the investment bank.

551
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,300
I grew up in an investment bank that was very small and

552
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,020
became very big when we came to DFA.

553
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,080
So when I think about my career,

554
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,580
it's aligning yourselves with the right firm,

555
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,000
given the interest they have,

556
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,720
where you think you can take incremental steps.

557
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,460
I just built it off of Jeff's comment,

558
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,120
and I do want to turn it over to the other two names.

559
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,060
What is the fundamental research animals have?

560
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:39,400
They have C -suite relationships, which you don't have,

561
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,740
and they have industry expertise, which you don't have.

562
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,540
What's their biggest fear?

563
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:46,900
Data analytics.

564
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,940
Because they know that that's important to how they're

565
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:50,900
going to continue to be relevant.

566
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:51,420
Why?

567
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,240
Because the C -suite at the firms that we research are

568
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,420
spending a lot of money on data analytics themselves.

569
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:01,100
And so if you can't converse in a meaningful way and

570
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:01,580
collaborate,

571
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:05,600
you're going to start to become less and less relevant to

572
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,360
the C -suite of research companies that we focus on.

573
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,100
So they need help.

574
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,520
That's my job, is to try to find the resources available.

575
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,040
That's why we're talking to you guys.

576
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,680
Does that make sense?

577
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:19,460
Does that answer your question?

578
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,320
Yes, very good.

579
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,020
So let's turn it over to Anand, if that's okay,

580
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,180
so we can get another play on how we're using that inside

581
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,180
the C -suite.

582
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,020
Hi there.

583
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,560
My name is Anand and I lead our consumer data analytics

584
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:38,980
office.

585
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,520
I'm here to tell you about...

586
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,220
I took this job only a couple of months back.

587
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,460
I was waiting for myself, like,

588
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,440
should I talk to you about the areas that we do machine

589
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:51,700
learning?

590
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,640
Should I talk to you about how the retail industry...

591
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,160
I work for the consumer bank,

592
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,620
so it's kind of part of the retail bank.

593
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:03,520
How the retail industry itself can use machine learning?

594
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,000
This is something I've been discussing with my leadership,

595
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:09,480
so I thought I would start with that and give you more of

596
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,860
an industry perspective rather than specific areas that we

597
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,520
do machine learning.

598
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:17,500
There was a question about how big SGRH is.

599
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,700
I'll start with how big the consumer bank is.

600
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,780
We are about $6 billion in revenues.

601
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:28,120
We have a $75 -76 billion portfolio in loans.

602
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,020
About the asset under management is about $65 billion.

603
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,900
These are big numbers.

604
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:38,840
Deposits of $110 billion that you are taking.

605
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:43,240
And to abide by itself could be a fortune of mine to come.

606
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,980
It's a huge part of the business.

607
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,560
that, not just because the news are big, the deposits,

608
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,780
for how many of you bank the tempest?

609
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,500
All right.

610
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,220
Thank you.

611
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:09,620
Your deposits are the big reason that we run other parts of

612
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,400
the bank, wholesale banking, which we bank,

613
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,360
to go pay it out.

614
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,040
Right?

615
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,620
The deposits are lifeblood for the bank.

616
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,760
So if you can move on.

617
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,780
This is a statistic from Boston Journal.

618
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,380
I'm not going to share anything with you.

619
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,680
This is from Boston Journal.

620
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:35,980
How many of you are banked with the top three banks in the

621
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:39,040
United States, JP Morgan, Liz Bardo, Bank of America?

622
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,700
Right up here.

623
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:46,040
All of you have given.

624
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,300
An incremental deposit of $118 billion into 2017.

625
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:56,760
Last year alone, BFA, JP Martin, Wells Fargo,

626
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,580
got an incremental deposits of $118 billion.

627
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:00,820
Just lifeguard of the bank.

628
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:02,020
Any bank.

629
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,020
Chief funding, right?

630
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:11,460
Regional banks that include Sanchez, DDNT, PNC, CAP -1,

631
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:12,680
MNT.

632
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,020
22 regional banks together.

633
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:20,460
Guess how much deposits they got in 2017 together.

634
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,480
People, make a guess.

635
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:27,320
It looks like negative, if I understand your chart.

636
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,120
This is not so good.

637
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:31,880
$100 million?

638
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,020
$100 billion?

639
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:33,880
$1 million.

640
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:34,520
$1 million?

641
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:35,820
Oh, that's too low.

642
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,160
Half a billion?

643
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,760
Because that would sink my heart.

644
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,100
Half a billion?

645
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:40,920
Half a billion?

646
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,020
$55 billion.

647
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:43,940
$55 billion?

648
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:44,960
$118 billion?

649
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,120
The divide is getting larger and larger and larger.

650
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,880
That is something to scale, right?

651
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,440
Bigger the bank, bigger the deposit growth.

652
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,960
Seems like that, right?

653
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:00,660
So I kind of think, how many of you think Google, Amazon,

654
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,660
and Facebook,

655
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,220
these kind of companies are going to rule the world?

656
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,380
I have quite a few.

657
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,100
I disagree with that notion, by the way.

658
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:08,780
I'll tell you why.

659
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,639
You know that?

660
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,840
Traditional banking model is being redefined.

661
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:19,179
Steph told me about how the traditional analysts aspired

662
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:20,719
with data scientists.

663
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,739
They could be better together.

664
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,639
We have proven the humanity by itself.

665
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,739
Man or women,

666
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:33,860
human plus machine together is better than human or

667
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:34,179
machine.

668
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,980
We are on this hybrid land today.

669
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:38,460
Traditional banking has been redefined.

670
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,920
How many of you have missed outcomes?

671
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,940
How many of you have made more than 100?

672
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,040
trades in the past one year.

673
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,400
J .B.

674
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:59,040
Morgan made all the investment accounts free if you're

675
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,300
making less than 100 trades.

676
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,220
99% of the class who do free trades in J .B.

677
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,640
Morgan, if you haven't noticed back on that,

678
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:10,060
I went back and checked how many trades I made last year,

679
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,480
57, I'll be okay with J .B.

680
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:12,780
Morgan.

681
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,480
Doesn't have to pay any free.

682
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,780
A lot of different business models are coming.

683
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:25,360
So you have to pay something, right?

684
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,520
Either you pay with your money,

685
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,860
which you do for other banks, but if you use J .B.

686
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,140
Morgan, you pay with your data.

687
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,700
A lot of subscription models are out there.

688
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,260
J .B.

689
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,400
Morgan wants to tie into a Netflix subscription model.

690
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:49,000
They want Here is another thing that is also a problem with

691
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,740
the traditional bank.

692
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:54,940
This is JP Morgan's offering software banking.

693
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:59,980
You have to have $75 ,000 in your deposit account,

694
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:03,060
or investment account, total investment assets,

695
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,100
to access their private loan.

696
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,700
They have lowered the bar.

697
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,100
This is going to change the industry.

698
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,380
In centrist, for all these services,

699
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:17,180
you need a minimum of $100 ,000 in investment assets,

700
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:21,680
or in some cases, $1 million or more in investment assets,

701
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:22,880
the lower the bar.

702
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,040
I think it is still flawed.

703
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:29,680
If I am not having $75 ,000 with them,

704
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:33,040
but I'm really a high -network guy, or a girl,

705
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,360
you wouldn't know.

706
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,000
So most of the industry is going with rules,

707
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,640
not with an adaptive machine learning type approach to

708
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,580
make, implement their strategies.

709
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:56,100
This is a challenge that I pose to my leadership in my

710
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,480
group in consumer.

711
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,580
What can we learn from other industries, right?

712
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:06,200
So some of you think Google or Amazon can rule the world.

713
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,300
I disagree.

714
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,360
Here is why.

715
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,100
If you look at pharma industry, right?

716
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,620
If you look at the list of all these companies,

717
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:17,560
these are huge companies, Johnson& Johnson, Roche, Pfizer,

718
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,620
Novartis, Bay Area.

719
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,640
All of them have more than 100 years of history.

720
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,000
They have weathered so much.

721
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:28,700
They have weathered the Great Depression, world wars,

722
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,960
they're still dominating the market, right?

723
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:37,780
All these companies started with organic industry, aspirin,

724
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:41,620
drugs like that.

725
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,360
Then they migrated to microbiology, vaccines.

726
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,720
insulin, antibiotics, and all that, right.

727
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,120
And then, now they are like genomics.

728
00:37:54,820 --> 00:38:00,960
They have a core of research and development, right.

729
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:01,820
That's their core.

730
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,860
They're driven from one market discipline to another

731
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,500
discipline, another knowledge discipline,

732
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,440
another knowledge discipline,

733
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,080
from organic industry to microbiology to genomics.

734
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:15,400
When it comes to banks, can you use the same template?

735
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,340
I think it is, yes.

736
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,720
In consumer bank, especially,

737
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,900
is the knowledge about the client?

738
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,800
If we go to village somewhere,

739
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,880
the killer knows who is coming in.

740
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,500
The baker comes in,

741
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:32,580
the killer knows whether the baker has a working family

742
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,180
they have.

743
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,820
They keep going to school and all that.

744
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,680
It's like a localized knowledge, right.

745
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:38,920
The knowledge of the client.

746
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:44,600
Is there a way to use that and treat the client

747
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:44,920
differently?

748
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,880
We need a differentiated client experience,

749
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,200
regardless of how much you want.

750
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,200
It's not like you have a $75 ,000,

751
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,040
I'll treat you in one way, $100 ,000 million,

752
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,180
I'll treat another way.

753
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:55,860
That's old school.

754
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:56,900
That's not going to work.

755
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:03,740
So if you use that kind of the same template,

756
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:08,660
for centuries, banks really thrive on intermediation.

757
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:10,820
Somebody wanted money.

758
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,420
Somebody has excess money.

759
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,000
Banks are in the ring.

760
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,400
A colleague who owns capital markets.

761
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,080
It's intermediation.

762
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,660
Worked very well for centuries.

763
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:25,500
Somebody in Columbia made a research and found out the

764
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,700
capital market type theme.

765
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,640
Remains of the 2% to 7% range for centuries.

766
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,000
Like from 600 bucks from the rotation CEO company onwards.

767
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,440
Very well.

768
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,120
Then access makes you a big part.

769
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,700
Do you know who said this?

770
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:51,680
The greatest invention the banking has done in the past 50

771
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,540
or 60 years is APM.

772
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,480
He was a chairman of the Fed.

773
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,620
Things that I would never say that.

774
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,840
Paul Walker said that, which is true.

775
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,120
The access to the money,

776
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,680
24 bits of that access to the money,

777
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,500
then from intermediation to access.

778
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,340
Today, it is client centricity.

779
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:21,340
Anybody who can do well in client centricity can do really

780
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:21,520
good.

781
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,020
So what does client centricity actually mean?

782
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:31,220
90% of Americans live 20 miles from the nearest Walmart.

783
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,280
90%, right?

784
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,480
When I go to Walmart, they're shaving cream.

785
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:38,620
Shave my hand.

786
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,680
Like socks, a T -shirt, or anything like that, right?

787
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,900
Walmart treats me.

788
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:51,120
as a way to push inventory out, clear inventory sales.

789
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,120
Banks are very similar.

790
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,360
They'll sell you a money market account, deposit account,

791
00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:00,940
credit cards, e -locks, mortgages, any of those sorts,

792
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:01,480
right?

793
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:05,800
If we go to Amazon .com, it's offline centric.

794
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,680
My landing page is very different from yours.

795
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:08,880
Very different from yours.

796
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,700
It's offline centric.

797
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,880
So the knowledge discipline that could take us into client

798
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:20,520
centricity is machine learning and analytics, right?

799
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:27,200
Here is another example of how this analytics can

800
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,480
differentiate us to the market.

801
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,300
You all take investment course.

802
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,640
I'm going to give you a, this is the question.

803
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:38,080
These companies, there are two different companies in here,

804
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,180
Blue and Red, right?

805
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,740
Both have very similar market cap, right?

806
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:44,480
One has...

807
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,160
And then from P -164, what companies are those?

808
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,480
They are the same industry.

809
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:52,980
Thank you, guys.

810
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,460
Another clue here.

811
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,080
Tesla and Ford.

812
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,280
Tesla and Ford, very close.

813
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,920
I mean, I like your thinking when you're going,

814
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:08,960
but it's similar.

815
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:11,320
Any guesses?

816
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,200
Look at their voice.

817
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,360
Number of people voice.

818
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,820
Look at the P.

819
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:21,620
There is some clue.

820
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:28,960
Salesforce?

821
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,320
Salesforce?

822
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,160
Salesforce and something else.

823
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,800
Close, but not quite right.

824
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,260
I'll give you an example.

825
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,400
They are an entertainment industry.

826
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,560
Yeah, thank you.

827
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,380
What is the network?

828
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:42,980
There you go.

829
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:43,900
Netflix and Walt Disney.

830
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:51,320
So why would Netflix have this P .E.?

831
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,260
That is Walt Disney is this much.

832
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:54,420
I can't quite see it.

833
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:56,580
What is it for Netflix, the P .E.?

834
00:42:56,580 --> 00:43:01,040
148 versus, yeah.

835
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,940
So we haven't gotten to P .E.

836
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,740
yet in the course,

837
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,600
but tell them first what that is so they know.

838
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,220
That's a multiple of the market rates.

839
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:14,200
So market rates one to three times more from the earnings

840
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,980
of Netflix versus 15 times more.

841
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,640
If you look it up, it would be a very good thing.

842
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:22,960
So if they earn $1 a year, there's $42.

843
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,440
And by the way, that's an outrageously large number.

844
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,020
Outrageously large number, right?

845
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,100
In any way, it's outrageously large number.

846
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,140
How do you really substantiate something?

847
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:37,300
Even if you give this recommendation,

848
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,560
you come up with some numbers, run algorithms, go,

849
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:43,820
and give this to Jeff or Bob.

850
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:45,980
even laugh at you.

851
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,160
Why would you give this?

852
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:49,040
That's a very make sense.

853
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:50,840
To me it makes sense.

854
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,240
Only one reason.

855
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Disney.

856
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:58,940
Disney owns LucasDome, Disney owns Pixar,

857
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,820
Disney owns Marvel.

858
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,780
They have all these assets, massive assets.

859
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,560
How many of you are Disney fans?

860
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,740
How many have Netflix accounts?

861
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,180
Disney has all these assets,

862
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:20,040
but when I go see a movie in a neighborhood A .M .T.

863
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:20,980
theater, right?

864
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:22,560
I'm an A .M .C.

865
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,200
customer, not a Disney customer.

866
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:31,060
If a wife is ten years old, so whatever he calls him,

867
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,400
so I find something which really suits him.

868
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:37,700
So I find I find something, I get it.

869
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,640
I'm a target client, or a Walmart client, by the way,

870
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:41,240
by the toy.

871
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,400
Disney has lost the sight of their client.

872
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,260
They accumulate the assets.

873
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:47,700
They don't have my incentive.

874
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:52,360
They cannot use machine learning and analytics like Netflix

875
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:52,760
does.

876
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,620
Netflix has all the right walks.

877
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,620
They know what to watch, what to don't watch,

878
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:02,860
how much we pause, how much we repeat, all that, right?

879
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,900
What is the use of all that?

880
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:08,200
Netflix was a DVD mailing company not long before.

881
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,900
And you were like kids.

882
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,360
So it wasn't that good.

883
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,920
Then when there's like,

884
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,180
they've worked at themselves and went for streaming.

885
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:22,940
And now they have 10% of Hollywood production.

886
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,400
From zero 10 years back to almost 10% of the Hollywood

887
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:27,760
production.

888
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:29,500
That comes with clients.

889
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:33,060
They will produce something and put out there the

890
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:35,280
confidence that Hollywood cannot do.

891
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:38,740
Hollywood economics is like a term, you must record, right?

892
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:41,540
You put something out there and pay for it for Netflix.

893
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:46,040
Many companies push products like the Hollywood economics.

894
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:50,880
They'll come up with some kind of business plan of sort,

895
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,740
which is essentially Hollywood economics.

896
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:55,900
Not Netflix, it doesn't have to.

897
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,720
So client -centricity is a theme for some firms and many

898
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,220
other banks.

899
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:05,380
And the more we do, the better we do on client -centricity,

900
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,580
I think we are going to win.

901
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:12,100
My bank is going to be very different from my bank.

902
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,520
And the bank of the future is going to use analytics.

903
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:19,920
It's going to use machine learning much more in an

904
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,340
effective way that could keep clients in this city.

905
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:27,200
And I walk in or take my mobile app and launch my app.

906
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:31,220
The bank would know me much better, just like the village,

907
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:35,620
20 years of experience, knowledge, the community,

908
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:37,500
that was knowledge to be packed.

909
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,300
And the only way we could pack that is through our

910
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,580
exclamation point, right?

911
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:45,620
stop.

912
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,640
I wanted to show something real quick,

913
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:50,020
a couple of minutes of video.

914
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:55,920
How many of you have heard a company called DataRobot?

915
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,240
A few of those, right?

916
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:04,580
So the reason I'm going to play this is you're going to

917
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:06,740
learn a lot about machine learning and how to do machine

918
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:13,120
learning, or the period of time you can take a little bit.

919
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,080
Controversial thing, I'm going to say.

920
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:18,640
Because artificial intelligence is going to automate many

921
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,500
of those, right?

922
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:26,300
So this is a company I visited like a year back.

923
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:30,000
Fascinated, we're going to do some experiments with them.

924
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:32,740
I'll play this on the top of my head.

925
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:37,580
DataRobot is an automated machine learning platform that

926
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:40,180
helps you solve business problems by finding the best

927
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:41,720
predictive model for your data.

928
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,520
And an incredibly clean interface allows analysts,

929
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:46,240
developers,

930
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:49,920
and data professionals to rapidly build highly accurate

931
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:50,920
predictive models,

932
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:54,200
embedding the best practices of the world's top data

933
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,440
scientists into every model they build.

934
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:00,760
Massively parallel processing allows users to build many

935
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:01,680
models at once,

936
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:05,200
so the work that used to take weeks now happens in an

937
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:05,580
afternoon.

938
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:09,960
Instead of guessing which model will work for any given

939
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:10,520
data set,

940
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:14,080
DataRobot systematically compares models built with

941
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:18,800
Python's scikit -learn, R, Spark, H2O, Valpal Web,

942
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,420
TensorFlow, and others.

943
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,940
Models are described with incredible transparency,

944
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,660
and DataRobot uses novel techniques to extract deep

945
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:29,560
insights from each and every one.

946
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,260
No, you can't use this for your homework.

947
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:37,800
You must commit by generating a simply elegant one -line

948
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,880
API code at the touch of a body.

949
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:42,320
With DataRobot,

950
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,120
you can deliver predictive analytics and insights to your

951
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,280
business in hours instead of months.

952
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:48,780
DataRobot,

953
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:52,160
the world's most advanced machine learning platform for

954
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:56,240
accurate predictive modeling made easy, fast, and powerful.

955
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,120
So there's a saying,

956
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,740
with all the getting and getting understanding,

957
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:09,100
a lot of wisdom to it.

958
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,540
Jeff talked about the data sets,

959
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,320
aggregating all those data sets and making sense,

960
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:20,380
like in a way that people influence people with clear

961
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:20,880
logic,

962
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,620
it will be worth much more than working on techniques.

963
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:31,180
There is a story from, you must have heard this,

964
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:34,180
the monk is passing through a village,

965
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:38,580
and he sees a couple of folks stacking stones at the

966
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:39,300
outskirts of the village.

967
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:41,960
So he's asking one of them, hey, what are you doing?

968
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,000
He says, Oh, can't you see, I'm just stacking stones.

969
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,080
So he passes 10 meters, 20 meters,

970
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:52,120
there's this other guy carrying the stones,

971
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,360
and he's asking the same question.

972
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:54,840
Hey, what are you doing?

973
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:57,060
The other guy says, oh,

974
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:58,700
you're building this beautiful cathedral.

975
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,360
This is going to be the biggest church in the village.

976
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,640
And he gives live information about it.

977
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:11,100
Machine learning analytics is like stacking stones.

978
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:12,660
Right?

979
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:17,720
What you do with it is much more important than how you do

980
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:18,040
it.

981
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:22,640
So if you are looking for a very, you are all very bright,

982
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:26,360
I think the thing that would differentiate you in the

983
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:29,060
marketplace and give you a lot of fulfillment in your

984
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:32,600
career is then build the cathedral.

985
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,800
And I know you all do it.

986
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:35,780
That's all.

987
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:36,460
Thank you.

988
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:50,800
So,

989
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,060
I am banking with JP Morgan because it has presence everywhere

990
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:59,620
even though I am in Atlanta right now, I go to more,

991
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,840
I go to different states and I want my,

992
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:06,300
I want my bank to a bank at least.

993
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:06,860
So,

994
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:11,200
how do you think SunTrust will be able to compete with that

995
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:11,560
in future?

996
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:11,940
So,

997
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:14,980
tomorrow there will be mobile banking because of that the

998
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:17,320
presence of the bank whether there is a branch or ATM in

999
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:20,720
there won't really matter or do you think expanding

1000
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,260
branches in various locations will be more helpful?

1001
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:29,540
The question is I want to bank with a bank which has

1002
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:33,060
presence in all states not with the regional bank which is

1003
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:33,500
localized.

1004
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,380
What do you think tomorrow is going to be?

1005
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:43,220
So, tomorrow the definition of bank will change.

1006
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:47,000
Do you think probably of branches and scientists?

1007
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:49,540
You probably think of mobile app tomorrow.

1008
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,860
There are a lot of, how many of you are from Europe?

1009
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:55,840
Do you bank with N26?

1010
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,640
Monzo, any of the internet only banks?

1011
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:02,700
It's catching up real, real quick.

1012
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:03,520
So,

1013
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:08,580
the notion of what banking will change and you will be able

1014
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:11,680
to identify with an entity that would manage or finance

1015
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:16,300
this in a very different way but just with technology

1016
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,300
rather than physical structure.

1017
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,940
That's my question.

1018
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:24,360
Any other questions?

1019
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:27,480
Yes.

1020
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:32,460
You highlighted the resilience of these companies and I

1021
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:38,120
wonder if you see if that's because that product that

1022
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:39,920
they're creating is more essential,

1023
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:41,500
where it's perceived to be.

1024
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:44,500
You see banking in a perceived similarly,

1025
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:45,940
an essential thing,

1026
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:51,040
or does that allow some flexibility in how fast you catch

1027
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,580
up with technology trends?

1028
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:54,860
So the question is,

1029
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:59,860
we talked about banking and pharma and financial services.

1030
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:02,340
Pharma is very essential if you don't take it or drive it

1031
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:02,520
by.

1032
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:04,640
So financial services,

1033
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:09,140
can you equate or what is the relationship, right?

1034
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:10,340
Is it the same?

1035
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:23,160
How many of you want to have a life that is out of poverty?

1036
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:25,820
How many of you don't want to suffer from poverty?

1037
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:31,660
How many of you want to buy a car?

1038
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:35,480
How many of you want to buy your dinner tonight?

1039
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:42,220
So when you think of bank, you don't think of all these.

1040
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:46,660
Essentially, financial services enables this and much more.

1041
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:51,860
It's fundamental to a society that wants to make progress.

1042
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:57,060
Whether the bank of today can do this well,

1043
00:53:58,620 --> 00:53:59,840
it's a test for tomorrow.

1044
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:01,540
The bank of the future is going to do it much,

1045
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,240
much better then.

1046
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,660
And we want to be the bank of the future.

1047
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:08,120
By the way, just like Bob's team is hiding,

1048
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:08,820
my team is hiding.

1049
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:10,180
That's me.

1050
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:11,760
Thank you.

1051
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:24,400
Hi, my name is John Marmalino.

1052
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:28,680
I represent the Risk and Finance Data Analytics Office.

1053
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:32,520
So I unfortunately don't have a slide or interesting

1054
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,020
presentation to show you.

1055
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:38,800
But what my area does is it manages data foundation and

1056
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:42,340
analytics capabilities that some trust uses to manage its

1057
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:44,600
risk and its financial performance.

1058
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:50,140
That has a fairly wide distribution of use cases where

1059
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:51,580
machine learning can come into play.

1060
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,660
So one microcosm of my space is financial products.

1061
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:57,520
So within the financial product space,

1062
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:01,860
we are monitoring for money laundering, human trafficking,

1063
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:06,940
terrorist financing, and then fraud, identity theft.

1064
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:11,020
Each one of those traditionally has presented different

1065
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:11,880
challenges for banks.

1066
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,160
To some extent,

1067
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:17,320
the old way of managing these things were to create traps

1068
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:18,320
for behaviors.

1069
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,220
So look for new accounts,

1070
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:23,460
look for accounts that were open out of state,

1071
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:29,160
look for accounts with multiple cash deposits,

1072
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:33,940
look for accounts that have frequently changed addresses.

1073
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,800
But the problem with any of those methods is those traps

1074
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,060
pretty quickly become obsolete.

1075
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:45,700
Criminals and the people who are intending to do harm to us

1076
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,960
are pretty quick at adapting and finding those traps.

1077
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:53,340
And then they operate in a way that's slightly outside of

1078
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:56,660
the capability of the rules to find them.

1079
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:01,000
Machine learning is truly an area where banks are starting

1080
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,840
to move into the forefront of machine learning,

1081
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:08,780
to create opportunities to bring lots of data together in a

1082
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:14,400
way that can be utilized to manage active threats and an

1083
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:21,040
ever changing method of committing fraud or laundering

1084
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,680
money or financing terrorism.

1085
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:24,840
But within our space,

1086
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:30,000
we have opportunities to develop machine learning models

1087
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,840
can deal with almost every aspect of it.

1088
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:36,300
So one of the, one of them, I'm gonna go very micro.

1089
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:37,820
I know these guys say very high level,

1090
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:38,720
I'm gonna go very micro.

1091
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:43,220
Common problem that the Fed takes is third party check

1092
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:43,480
fraud.

1093
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:47,800
So what that means is you as a SunTrust client are

1094
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:50,260
presented with a check from outside of SunTrust.

1095
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:52,700
So it's not a SunTrust check,

1096
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,980
it's could be Bank of America, we'd make it China,

1097
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:56,600
it could be anybody.

1098
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,820
They write a check, they present it to us.

1099
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:02,080
We have to, per law,

1100
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:06,980
make an assessment very quickly within 24 hours really,

1101
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:10,580
determine whether your check needs to be held or whether we

1102
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:12,660
need to make those funds available to you.

1103
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:15,700
To do that,

1104
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:18,280
we need to bring together a vast amount of information.

1105
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,480
We need to understand who you are,

1106
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,540
what is your routine types of activities?

1107
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:25,920
Is this outside of the norm for you?

1108
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:30,020
Are you likely to be committing fraud at SunTrust?

1109
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:34,940
But above that, I know you, I like you, I trust you.

1110
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:36,940
Do I know the other guy?

1111
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,660
Do I know the guy who wrote you the check?

1112
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:41,320
Do I know the institution the check was written from?

1113
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:44,580
That requires us to bring in, to play,

1114
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,300
information that could be provided by us at the party.

1115
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:51,780
It could be other information that we house across the

1116
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:52,280
organization.

1117
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:54,120
It could be on the lists,

1118
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:56,140
watch lists that we've accumulated,

1119
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:58,200
watch lists that we purchased.

1120
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:01,260
And we bring all that information to bear to determine

1121
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:04,100
whether or not there's a probability of fraud on that

1122
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:04,320
check.

1123
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:08,420
I presented a whole new host of problems that banks haven't

1124
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:10,300
typically been able to deal with.

1125
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:11,140
In the past,

1126
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:13,120
the way we could deal with it is we would just call it

1127
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:13,320
checks.

1128
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:17,020
So I was presented by a third party check.

1129
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,860
The traditional way to handle that was we just wouldn't

1130
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:22,440
catch the check until the other bank made good on the

1131
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,800
check, deposited their funds into our accounts.

1132
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:27,580
We felt that it was pretty safe to now make those funds

1133
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:28,320
available to you.

1134
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,360
But the world is changing, one.

1135
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,260
clients won't stand for it.

1136
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:34,960
But two, the regulators won't bother.

1137
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:36,680
So in this case,

1138
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:40,460
we're bringing together data sets from a vast amount of

1139
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:40,840
sources.

1140
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,440
So in some cases, structured data,

1141
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:47,100
where we're looking at things like your account balances,

1142
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:50,520
what your addresses, unstructured data,

1143
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:56,140
where we're pulling information out of your social media in

1144
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:58,280
order to ensure that you're managing the risk -important

1145
00:58:58,280 --> 00:58:58,540
data.

1146
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:01,480
The key to this, when you think about it,

1147
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,600
is really the application.

1148
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:07,460
So while it's very specific to a one -use case for

1149
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:11,040
SunTrust, the techniques and the capabilities,

1150
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:16,140
the techniques and capabilities that this provides to us is

1151
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:16,880
actually utilized,

1152
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,200
it could be utilized by many of those sources.

1153
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,620
So when a non -talk to you about clients' interests and you

1154
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:23,160
know the client,

1155
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:27,640
there's an extremely valuable proposition to SunTrust to

1156
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,100
make sure that we're offering you that.

1157
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,720
products and services And he will go without doing that for

1158
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:36,220
his purposes But the same techniques that he's going to

1159
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:39,320
need to do that But know who his clients are what the

1160
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:42,920
probabilities of his clients are to take an offer What his

1161
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:46,780
clients need is going to be the same types of activities

1162
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:49,980
and techniques that we need to do to monitor fraud or to

1163
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:54,180
monitor risk of the client You had an earlier question as

1164
00:59:54,180 --> 01:00:00,840
to whether or not a French physical location Matters,

1165
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:01,780
right?

1166
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:05,660
So JP Morgan JP Morgan is located in lots of places Bank of

1167
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:11,400
America similarly Does that matter and the reality is the

1168
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:17,780
physical location of the lessons We're moving to a Point

1169
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:21,780
where the client Aspects its financial institutions to be

1170
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:25,940
available to it when it needs it now that isn't tomorrow

1171
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:30,120
morning between the hours of nine 4pm that's whenever the

1172
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:30,780
client needs it.

1173
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:35,160
So You see you see the advent of things like demo PayPal

1174
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:40,000
Capabilities to move money and rate around very quickly You

1175
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,340
see in the advent of more mobile applications for trading

1176
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:46,460
so that clients can trade I've worked with SunTrust for 13

1177
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:48,980
years and every day when I walk into the office I pass a

1178
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:51,420
branch of SunTrust branches within our physical building.

1179
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:57,100
I've been in that branch probably 10 times in 13 years and

1180
01:00:57,100 --> 01:01:01,200
most of the time because I need to make change Most banks

1181
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:05,040
most people don't need physical locations And so the

1182
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:09,320
relevancy of our of our institution is our ability to make

1183
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:13,060
SunTrust available to you as a client When you need it now

1184
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:15,500
that has implications on the risk space because what that

1185
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:20,320
means is I can't risk review Your loan application as you

1186
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:24,040
present it by the time you're ready to apply for a You

1187
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:28,020
probably have already decided meet the loan Want the money

1188
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:30,940
now and you're probably in a place where you want to make

1189
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:31,500
the purchase.

1190
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:34,260
If you think about the way you handle car purchases,

1191
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:37,980
for example, you walk into a dealership,

1192
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:39,420
you don't have financing,

1193
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,680
you probably don't have enough money to buy the car

1194
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:42,020
immediately,

1195
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:45,940
but you walk into a branch or a dealership and each out of

1196
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:47,340
the car, yeah, how much do you pay,

1197
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,500
how much do you want your payments to be,

1198
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:52,340
and then you go to a finance office and they'll be a risk

1199
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:52,520
rate.

1200
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:54,660
The future of banking will be,

1201
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:58,020
you have been risk rated as a client every single day,

1202
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:01,620
and every time you do something through the bank,

1203
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:04,600
or really anything that we capture or we monitor,

1204
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:06,540
updates your risk profile.

1205
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:10,380
And then we make available to you the services and

1206
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:12,800
offerings based on the risk profile you present to us.

1207
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:14,460
That's the future of banking.

1208
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:16,440
That's where banking will be in the future.

1209
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:19,020
And so we will continue to be relevant if we are able to

1210
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:19,260
adapt.

1211
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:23,360
The banks that are able to adapt can make the financial

1212
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:26,380
institutions available to you at the time you need to

1213
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:26,800
transact.

1214
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:28,960
Those are going to be the banks that will survive.

1215
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,440
SunTrust has made a tremendous amount of investment over

1216
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:34,160
the past five years on data infrastructure,

1217
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:40,580
large data capabilities, and advanced tools like DataRobot.

1218
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:43,260
The challenge will always be the information.

1219
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:45,200
The information feeding those machines,

1220
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:50,580
the tools and techniques that are used to analyze and to

1221
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:51,260
make decisions.

1222
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:53,400
But the applications are limitless.

1223
01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:56,520
So while we're talking about some very specific use cases,

1224
01:02:56,700 --> 01:03:00,280
they're not limited at all to those use cases we talked

1225
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:00,640
about.

1226
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:05,720
To give you some ideas, the regression models,

1227
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:10,380
the regression models that were used to do Moneyball,

1228
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:11,960
I don't know if all of you guys saw Moneyball,

1229
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,440
first use of statistics and baseball to manage baseball

1230
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:15,720
teams.

1231
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:19,320
Those are the same regression models we use for forecasting

1232
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:22,880
balance sheet activity, probability of default.

1233
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:27,620
The analytics that are used to determine portfolio

1234
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:31,260
optimization for the machine learning that's used or the

1235
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:33,840
neural networks that are used to do machine learning are

1236
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:36,320
the same models that we use for optimizing balance sheets,

1237
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:38,400
size, parameters.

1238
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:41,600
The techniques are what is important.

1239
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:44,120
The types of information you need to solve the problem are

1240
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:44,640
what's important.

1241
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:49,520
The particular use case is less relevant because I promise

1242
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:52,160
you the problems you will work on the first year you get

1243
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:56,160
out of this program will be completely irrelevant to you 20

1244
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:56,960
years into your career.

1245
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:59,020
The challenges you will face,

1246
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:01,140
the problems you will have to address,

1247
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:03,700
the tools that you will use, the languages,

1248
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,240
they won't exist in 20 years.

1249
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,580
They probably won't exist in five years after you graduate,

1250
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,700
but they probably won't exist in 20 years after you

1251
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:10,940
graduate.

1252
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:13,660
But the foundational capabilities,

1253
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:17,160
the thought process around what types of information do I

1254
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:19,900
need, what types of analytics do I need to apply,

1255
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:22,820
that is foundational to the success of you and your careers

1256
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:23,320
in the future.

1257
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:26,640
So while we talk about the risk and finance base and

1258
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:29,640
capabilities that we provide, bank operate,

1259
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,500
or within the consumer bank,

1260
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:34,920
or within Robertson offering the client bank,

1261
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:39,760
or investment bank, those are all utilities,

1262
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:43,980
capabilities being applied to a specific set of problems.

1263
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:49,220
I would say that once you can articulate the problem,

1264
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:52,080
the techniques that need to be applied to solve those

1265
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:53,820
problems are foundational.

1266
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:57,920
With that, I'll open it up to questions.

1267
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:59,640
I know some of you are probably ready to leave.

1268
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:04,460
So, what if we get the whole sentence came up there,

1269
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:08,760
and I've got a couple questions I can ask from online.

1270
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:14,120
Just ask, you asked a great question.

1271
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:18,480
The way that you think about companies,

1272
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:21,940
and their ability to thrive and survive,

1273
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:25,420
is oftentimes they have to come up with the right use case.

1274
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:28,540
Right, if you're a transportation company.

1275
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,940
and you happen to make a course of buggies,

1276
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:36,340
you are smart enough to engage in combustion engines and

1277
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:39,140
emerging technologies without the transformation of what

1278
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:39,640
they may cause.

1279
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,000
So I don't think it's the existential nature of the product

1280
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,240
that creates a success.

1281
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:48,420
I think it's how you think about yourself as a company.

1282
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:50,200
And in this instance,

1283
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:53,160
SunTrust defines itself as a publisher of the product.

1284
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:57,260
And our job is to reduce your financial stress by allowing

1285
01:05:57,260 --> 01:05:58,160
you to wait for the actual operation.

1286
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,200
And if we think about that,

1287
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:03,180
then the products that we bring to market are gonna be

1288
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:03,900
substantially different.

1289
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:06,720
Because we're gonna be there at the point of transaction.

1290
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,080
We're gonna not only make it easier to transact,

1291
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,980
we're gonna let you know the transaction you made is

1292
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:14,180
actually a good one on the other side, right?

1293
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,880
So I think more broadly speaking than just the bank,

1294
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:20,020
that's how you generally differentiate the successful

1295
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:23,620
companies who've been here for a long time versus those

1296
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:24,560
that died, right?

1297
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:26,540
When I say we need to show top 10s at the end of the

1298
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:28,440
survive, I think I'll show the 300 we did.

1299
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:30,700
Sorry, go ahead.

1300
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:35,440
I just wanted to pull a couple of questions from online so

1301
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:37,120
everybody is participating here.

1302
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:41,380
One question is, so in this class we,

1303
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:46,120
I kind of take the easy way out and I say volatility is

1304
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:46,460
risk.

1305
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:49,060
But what are other ways,

1306
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,180
what are other sorts of risks or how do you evaluate risks?

1307
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:57,060
And you're the head risk guy, so what's your answer?

1308
01:06:57,460 --> 01:06:58,340
Well, so first of all,

1309
01:06:58,380 --> 01:06:59,680
I would say volatility is opportunity.

1310
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:00,860
Yes, it is risk.

1311
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:03,280
But that's the opposite end of it, right?

1312
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:04,660
So it's the other side of the point.

1313
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:07,820
Risk is opportunity.

1314
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:10,500
Managing risk creates opportunity.

1315
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:15,220
The company that can bank you when no one else will bank

1316
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:18,720
you, if there's an opportunity to be made,

1317
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:20,920
those are the banks that will be profitable.

1318
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:26,640
So it's about using advanced analytics and information to

1319
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:29,480
manage the risk, not eliminate it, right?

1320
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,760
You have to manage it, of course.

1321
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:34,440
But there's lots of times of risk.

1322
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:36,280
You manage all kinds of risk.

1323
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:41,160
If, may I add, the biggest risk,

1324
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:46,360
usually the folks who begin their career in data science

1325
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:50,980
make is data is a good one.

1326
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:55,480
That is because nobody has the perfect data.

1327
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:01,540
You collect a lot of data, but that is the same.

1328
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:05,920
Companies measure what they want to see,

1329
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:08,020
and they make all set out of those.

1330
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:12,060
If I was a data scientist in 2008,

1331
01:08:12,620 --> 01:08:15,360
many of you were probably little kids back then.

1332
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:18,040
Was there anything such a thing as data science in people?

1333
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:19,180
Yeah, maybe.

1334
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:21,040
We all had something else.

1335
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:26,160
I'd say if I did analytics in 2008 and in Sony,

1336
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:28,660
and you come to me and ask.

1337
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,899
what kind of cameras I need to sell.

1338
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:36,000
So I do a lot of algorithms, run models, and say, OK,

1339
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:38,260
you need to sell high -definition cameras.

1340
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:40,460
2008 is when iPhone came out.

1341
01:08:41,420 --> 01:08:43,819
You need to do high -definition cameras,

1342
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:46,500
put a lot of money in this geography and all that.

1343
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:50,899
Across the street from Sony, there was another company,

1344
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:53,580
Zero Market Cap, like a startup.

1345
01:08:53,939 --> 01:08:56,540
They were making crappy cameras where you could put it on

1346
01:08:56,540 --> 01:08:59,939
your belt, pull a book, better what you want.

1347
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,140
Like, they're crappy cameras.

1348
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:04,700
And you could put it on your social network.

1349
01:09:04,899 --> 01:09:05,580
What company is that?

1350
01:09:07,859 --> 01:09:11,700
No amount of data out of machine learning can turn Sony to

1351
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:12,979
a GoPro, right?

1352
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:16,180
So we also have to think about strategy as the whole

1353
01:09:16,180 --> 01:09:16,819
arching thing.

1354
01:09:16,979 --> 01:09:23,779
The human mind can bring in a lot more things and make

1355
01:09:23,779 --> 01:09:24,279
decisions.

1356
01:09:24,859 --> 01:09:26,819
Data is an aid to all of us.

1357
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,560
So if you bring both of those,

1358
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:32,319
I think the risk is going with one or the other,

1359
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:33,420
bringing them together.

1360
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:34,680
That's what I'm saying.

1361
01:09:34,779 --> 01:09:36,340
In fact, if I could add to that,

1362
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:39,620
the biggest challenge you're going to face in your career

1363
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:43,319
is access to the information you need to do the analysis.

1364
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:46,420
It's not the analytics that needs, not the software.

1365
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:47,200
It's not that.

1366
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:48,200
It's going to be,

1367
01:09:48,359 --> 01:09:52,140
do you have access to the information you need to build the

1368
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:52,359
model?

1369
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:55,540
And when you build the model,

1370
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:58,840
can you get that information in a timely enough way to make

1371
01:09:58,840 --> 01:09:59,300
a difference?

1372
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:02,980
It's all fine and good if I have a perfect vision of you

1373
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:04,340
every month, once a month.

1374
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:08,800
But if you want to make a loan three days after I've got

1375
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,020
that perfect vision of you, it's useless.

1376
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:14,080
I need to know everything about you when you want to do

1377
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:14,340
something.

1378
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:16,160
And that's going to be checked.

1379
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:17,820
So I'll answer.

1380
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:18,940
I'm the trader in the room.

1381
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:22,500
So when you tell me there's more volatility,

1382
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,760
what I'll tell you is all the things is the difference of

1383
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:25,020
opinion.

1384
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:27,580
So what is your core thesis?

1385
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:28,980
What are the issues?

1386
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,560
analytics and data that you're using to know that court

1387
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:35,300
thesis is proving to be right or wrong and how do you cut

1388
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:38,520
your losses right so increased volatility creates that

1389
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:41,540
opportunity but also makes you really think long and hard

1390
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:44,540
about the parameters that you're willing to take risk in

1391
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:47,880
and how to get out of the position the number one problem

1392
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:52,000
with the trader that I will have for the last 25 years the

1393
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:59,180
next thing is traders who start to deviate their thesis

1394
01:10:59,180 --> 01:11:04,100
from their position why they own something starts to change

1395
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:09,240
that shouldn't happen you should reset and then a land of

1396
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:12,780
high vol if you just put a trade on and it moves against

1397
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:15,280
you immediately you did a lot of work to come up with

1398
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:17,340
putting the trade on you gotta be willing to throw in the

1399
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:23,020
garbage you start over I think we need to close now however

1400
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:26,160
I believe they're available you Still for a few more

1401
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:26,440
minutes,

1402
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:28,720
so let's thank them and then if you have more questions,

1403
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:29,480
please come up here
