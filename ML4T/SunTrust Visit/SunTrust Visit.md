# SunTrust Visit


**Introduction and Greetings**
- So, thank you very much, everyone, for joining us today. We're going to get started now. Hello there in TV land. We have our online members also participating. Today is a special day I try each semester at least once to have professionals who actually apply machine learning and AI in finance come and speak to us.

**Introduction of SunTrust Team**
- Today we're fortunate to have a team from some trust who is a hit for you today. Here in Atlanta, you can tell us some of the things they do with finance using some of the same tools right here.

**Recruitment Announcement**
- Also be advised that they are looking too higher, potentially both full -time folks and interns. So pay attention, take down their email addresses. During the presentations, they've said that they're willing to answer questions along the way. So if you have a question, please raise your hand and ask.

**Question Protocol**
- One thing for some trustees, repeat the question because the people online aren't necessarily going to have heard it. So repeat it. Also, sometimes someone's up front with people in the back here, so we'll get to questions.

**Introduction of Presenter**
- Anyways, let me start off by inviting Bob Papowski to come out then and give us an overview of the questions. We're going to hear from some.

**Speaker Introduction and Role**
- Good afternoon, my name is Bob. What I do within Subtrust is I'm responsible for sales creating research and the investment bank. So when you think about the investment process, we'll talk a little bit about that today.

**Overview of Topics and Introduction of Team**
- We help facilitate investors investing in securities right and how we apply Machine learning AI algorithms and tools is a little bit of a different version of what and how traditional investments Magic company edge funding Along with me. I have Jeff Hughes who's responsible for equity research I'll talk briefly about three things that we're doing thinking about doing he'll be talking about one of those three things As well we have I'm in the spot of the emergency who's responsible for data and analytics AI machine learning within the consumer bank and we have John who is responsible for Risk in analytics with this event itself And so I'll briefly touch on three things and I'll pass it off.

**Introduction to Investment Banking Processes**
- Three main bodies of work exist within investment banks at the moment including Subtrust for office and how free first is trade identification Okay So if you think about what a dealer is a dealer is a market maker who is trying to buy and sell securities Some of them they own some of them. They don't know Some of these markets are not people.

**Role of Machine Learning in Trade Identification**
- Machine learning and analytics will be able to and do analyze behaviors individuals at companies of companies themselves and the predictive analytics that we can deploy to determine whether or not a transaction is a suitable fit could in fact make a transaction happen between us at the investment bank and that client as opposed to calling another investment bank away from us.

**Evolution of Trade Execution**
- The trade identification is a big and important deal that's fairly new. If you think about it, it's kind of what Amazon does in a different application. Trade execution. The traditionally trade execution within investment bank in the sales and trading groups has been identified through, identified factors that could be quickly analyzed to produce a price with or without human intervention.

**Impact of Cloud Computing and Machine Learning**
- That's been around for a long time. What's changing is the analytical power that's available through cloud computing and other computing services that allow for the machines to start to learn how to enhance the algorithms independently of human intervention.

**Future Trends in Trade Algorithms**
- Trade algorithms that start to use machine learning to determine and optimize the business model itself.

**Role of Research and Data Science**
- Lastly, research. A large part of what investment banks do, and we're no different, is spend a lot of time analyzing companies, analyzing markets. And in order to do that, we need a data science program behind you that supports all three disciplines I just talked about.

**Encouragement for Future Leaders**
- What I would say, more broadly speaking, having grown up, I was originally a science major and then changed to finance. I wish I stayed in science because the market is coming your way. A lot of what we're going to be working on, and I believe a lot of the future leaders of not only STRH, but broadly speaking, investment banks are going to have your backgrounds. So the more you can focus on programming and understanding finance, the more applicable you're going to be to how we're trying to develop our company and how the market is trying to recruit talent as well.

**Invitation for Questions and Transition to Jeff**
- So I won't answer any questions throughout the day, but I don't want to take Jeff's time, so I'll pass it off to Jeff so he can talk a little bit more about data science as it relates to equity research.


**Introduction**

Good afternoon, everyone. It's a pleasure to be on Georgia Tech's campus. You definitely sent us the Vibrantee back room. It's great to be here at campus. As Bob mentioned, my name is Jeff Utes. I run equity research at SunTrust Roberts and Humphrey.

**Background and Experience**

Quick background before I get into talking about how we and the sell side is using data analytics to provide value, add value to the buy side. I've been at SunTrust Roberts and Humphrey for five years. I've been director of equity research in that capacity. Before joining SunTrust Roberts and Humphrey, I spent 15 years at a global investment bank, spending time in New York as well as Chicago. Before that, I received my MBA at the Fuqua School of Business at Duke. And before that, I spent seven years in corporate banking in Chicago, and I received my undergrad at the University of Notre Dame. As Bob mentioned, I think 20 years from now, maybe even 10 years from now, maybe seven years from now, the background of the Directors of Equity Research will have backgrounds like yours, not mine.

**Overview of the Securities Industry**

So this is very relevant, I think, and the opportunities in this career for folks with your background are significant and substantial. Before I get started on talking a little bit about analytics, I wanna just give everyone a little background on our industry, the securities industry.

**Understanding Key Terms**

And there are a lot of terms that are thrown around, buy side, sell side, issuers, and I just wanna make sure that everyone understands some of the basics here. On the sell side, we're talking about broker dealers, the investment thing, some trust around some people.

**Roles in Equity Research**

What is a sell side analyst do? In our research department, we have about 100 teammates and about 40 publishing equity research analysts covering a variety of industries, from TMT to financials to consumer to industrials to energy, you name it, they cover verticals, sub -verticals, etc.

**Evolution of Equity Research**

The job is really to change pretty dramatically from being a reporter of earnings previews and reviews to really doing more value added work now. Our research analysts are on the road an awful lot. They spend a lot of time doing proprietary research, attending conferences, also taking up our companies, the companies that we cover on the road to see institutional investors as well.

**Importance of Data Analytics**

So, the job is changing, I referenced that earlier. The job of a research analyst used to be focused on publishing earnings previews and earnings recaps and that's really become commoditized. The real value added now is coming up of quantitative differentiated proprietary work that the buy side will pay for.

**Utilizing Alternative Data**

When we talk about Alternative data want to make sure everyone's kind of clear on this how was it and how the buy side is using it Generally to find alternative data is independent data.

**Data Management and Analytics**

How are How is data analytics used in the research process really two ways number one is is data management and the second and second? Item is advanced analytics Data management you have to obtain the data first Extract it it comes from you come from labor intensive Web scraping or you can buy the data from third -party data providers

**Applications of Data Analytics**

Here's some examples on the next few slides. I've got some examples of of Analytics and specific verticals that we'll talk about I'm not going to go through every single one of these But you can take a look at these online and and see some of the applications of how they're used within consumer Space we have an analyst right now covers cruise lines, and he scrapes cruise line data From websites from either travel agency websites or directly from the cruise lines And he finds changes in pricing to be very effective in understanding the trends in top line That's been very well received By the buy side.

**Case Study: Amazon's Private Label Business**

There's a current use example that's pretty neat. About three or four months ago our internet analyst, Yusuf Scully, came out with a report really focusing on Amazon and specifically their private label business clothing specifically.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the times are really changing in equity research on the buy side as well as the sell side. The days of sell side research analysts relying on quarterly previews and reviews to do primary research, the buy side just won't pay for that anymore. The buy side is demanding more proprietary, creative, and quantitative research from the sell side. And technology advancements are creating a tremendous amount of opportunity here for us to have value to look up the key proprietary insights to offer the buy side. The Holy Grail is taking the expertise, the experience of our analysts combined with the technology tools that are in place right now and are continuing to evolve. The power of the data as well as the combining with the intellectual capabilities of our analysts is really where the Holy Grail is with regards to how the buy side is using sell side research going forward.



**Question 1:**
- And with that, I'm happy to take any questions. One over there. Sir? I was wondering about the process. How you look at a given company in this sector and determining in the end which kind of data sources are relevant for making any valuable predictions if there's like it's more of a scientific process or it's more of a hard question.

**Answer 1:**
- So the question is, when we come up with, when you're looking at companies, how do we assess what data sources that will be valuable? Is that kind of the gist of the question? So that's a very good question.

- And it really comes up, it comes down to, our analysts all have quite a bit of experience in our industry experts understanding what the key drivers are with regard to the top one I mentioned. The impact on the business model.
- And a lot of it is just having an understanding, being an industry expert and understanding what will drive those key variables. Give me an example. There are some third party data providers who will give you parking lot data.
- So if you have a consumer analyst who covers Home Depot or Lowe's, for example, Home Depot or company, there are entities out there that will provide parking lot data, satellite feeds, to give you an understanding of how busy the parking lot is, specifically on weekends, because that's when the majority of sales occurs for these two companies.
- And you can have a greater understanding of the weather impact, for example. There's been particularly dismal weather in the spring that can have an adverse impact on traffic for Home Depot, specifically in the garden.
- Area Home Depot and that that can really drive your term. It's all true at Home Depot or less. That's one example It's you know, it's really having an understanding of what's driving the underlying metrics that are most important Might be the same store sales comps in a retail Environment might be foot traffic.
- It really depends on specific industry specific company I don't please what I might say is on top of that.
- So I think the answer is it can be both We're starting to develop on the thesis. It can be both that You know, we want the expertise of fundamental analysts tell us that think are interesting and then we try to find better ways to access data or more unique data sets that maybe you a couple layers below that but then there's also the discipline of Finding unique data sets and patterns things that we didn't think were correlated to a particular stock Right, and that's the initiative that we're starting to kick off in 2019 so I think you can approach it from a data science perspective and that can inform An equity fundamental research analyst and then you can take equity fundamental research and you can find better You know patterns and and data sets Around the things they care about right a lot of firms are setting up firms being investment banks Setting up subsidiaries around the thesis that you can create unique data sets They go into the revenue graph that Jeff showed early But I think that's probably a fair assessment of the capacity to both empower the 40 analysts that we have But also create a new discipline and a new product that could be sold into the buy side as well I Didn't mean to take precedence over sorry well imagine a fresh Georgia Tech graduate completes this course, starts work at SunTrust.

**Question 2:**
- Where would you imagine they would plug in here? So for instance, would they be paired with an analyst and do studies for them? Would they be an analyst? How does that work?

**Answer 2:**
- The answer to that question is because there's plenty of opportunities at SunTrust.
- Rob is now free. Yes, you could come in and work with one of our industry experts. But Bob referenced a new investment that SunTrust, Rob is making in data analytics and data science. We were building a data science team.
- We're in the process of trying to hire a data scientist right now. And then we'll be building a team around that person. So there would be great opportunities there to come in and work with our data scientists who are interviewing folks right now, actually, for that senior level position.
- So there's plenty of opportunities. And I truly do believe that 10 years from now, 12 years from now, next DOR will have some quantitative experience. So I keep them all out.

**Question 3:**
- What data makes you very all using to store your data? Are you using something centralized? Second, specific tools you are using for advanced analytics, specific languages you like to play in, visualization packages.

**Answer 3:**
- OK, sure. So the question is, what data sets are we using right now? Pardon me?
- Data bases. Data bases. What kind of analytical tools are we using right now? And then the size of centrist Robinson Humphrey. Let me start with the last one, which is the easiest for someone who doesn't have a lot of background.
- Some trust Robinson Humphrey is about $2 billion in revenues, roughly, right? Our investment bank, the investment bank, subsidiary of some trust bank. The bottom line, probably, if you want to keep it.
- So the investment bank is about 1 ,160 people. Sales and trading is about 360 of that. Every research is about 100 of that. The data analytics team I have is about seven people. At the moment, that's going to continue to work, right?
- It's a fairly new initiative for us. There are a few databases. One is centrally owned. The nice thing about being associated with bank, and we have two other colleagues who come up and speak, is that there's a lot of infrastructure that's available in shared services.
- So there's a data lake that's available for big data. And analytics around the data lake, we haven't called out. There's a recent initiative that was stood up within some trust bank itself. And so I get built for free in life, but I have the ability to access tools.
- Primarily, every research analyst and journalist people, the QCF folks that we have. most of them have actually come from this college, are folks on Python and ARP, and analytics around it. But we're in very early stages, as Jeff mentioned, building out a data science team.
- I think that's, to me, an exciting thing, right? A lot of opportunity is available when you're starting something new around the investment bank. I grew up in an investment bank that was very small and became very big when we came to DFA.
- So when I think about my career, it's aligning yourselves with the right firm, given the interest they have, where you think you can take incremental steps. I just built it off of Jeff's comment, and I do want to turn it over to the other two names.
- What is the fundamental research animals have? They have C -suite relationships, which you don't have, and they have industry expertise, which you don't have. What's their biggest fear? Data analytics.
- Because they know that that's important to how they're going to continue to be relevant. Why? Because the C -suite at the firms that we research are spending a lot of money on data analytics

 themselves.
- And so if you can't converse in a meaningful way and collaborate, you're going to start to become less and less relevant to the C -suite of research companies that we focus on. So they need help. That's my job, is to try to find the resources available.
- That's why we're talking to you guys. Does that make sense? Does that answer your question? Yes, very good. So let's turn it over to Anand, if that's okay, so we can get another play on how we're using that inside the C -suite.

**Title: Revolutionizing Banking with Data Analytics and Machine Learning**

**Introduction to Consumer Data Analytics**
Hi there. My name is Anand and I lead our consumer data analytics office. I'm here to tell you about... I took this job only a couple of months back. I was waiting for myself, like, should I talk to you about the areas that we do machine learning?

**The Role of Machine Learning in Retail Banking**
Should I talk to you about how the retail industry... I work for the consumer bank, so it's kind of part of the retail bank. How the retail industry itself can use machine learning? This is something I've been discussing with my leadership, so I thought I would start with that and give you more of an industry perspective rather than specific areas that we do machine learning.

**Understanding Consumer Bank Statistics**
There was a question about how big SGRH is. I'll start with how big the consumer bank is. We are about $6 billion in revenues. We have a $75 -76 billion portfolio in loans. About the asset under management is about $65 billion.

**Importance of Deposits in Banking**
These are big numbers. Deposits of $110 billion that you are taking. And to abide by itself could be a fortune of mine to come. It's a huge part of the business. that, not just because the news are big, the deposits, for how many of you bank the tempest?
All right. Thank you. Your deposits are the big reason that we run other parts of the bank, wholesale banking, which we bank, to go pay it out. Right? The deposits are lifeblood for the bank. So if you can move on.

**Impact of Deposit Growth**
This is a statistic from Boston Journal. I'm not going to share anything with you. This is from Boston Journal. How many of you are banked with the top three banks in the United States, JP Morgan, Liz Bardo, Bank of America?

**Shifts in Banking Business Models**
Right up here. All of you have given. An incremental deposit of $118 billion into 2017. Last year alone, BFA, JP Martin, Wells Fargo, got an incremental deposits of $118 billion. Just lifeguard of the bank.

**Challenges in Regional Banking**
Any bank. Chief funding, right? Regional banks that include Sanchez, DDNT, PNC, CAP -1, MNT. 22 regional banks together. Guess how much deposits they got in 2017 together. People, make a guess. It looks like negative, if I understand your chart.

**Adaptations in Banking**
This is not so good. $100 million? $100 billion? $1 million. $1 million? Oh, that's too low. Half a billion? Because that would sink my heart. Half a billion? Half a billion? $55 billion. $55 billion?

**The Evolution of Banking**
$118 billion? The divide is getting larger and larger and larger. That is something to scale, right? Bigger the bank, bigger the deposit growth. Seems like that, right? So I kind of think, how many of you think Google, Amazon, and Facebook, these kind of companies are going to rule the world?

**Redefining Traditional Banking**
I have quite a few. I disagree with that notion, by the way. I'll tell you why. You know that? Traditional banking model is being redefined. Steph told me about how the traditional analysts aspired with data scientists.

**The Integration of Human and Machine**
They could be better together. We have proven the humanity by itself. Man or women, human plus machine together is better than human or machine. We are on this hybrid land today. Traditional banking has been redefined.

**Adapting to Changing Business Models**
How many of you have missed outcomes? How many of you have made more than 100? trades in the past one year. J .B. Morgan made all the investment accounts free if you're making less than 100 trades.

**Subscription Models in Banking**
A lot of different business models are coming. So you have to pay something, right? Either you pay with your money, which you do for other banks, but if you use J .B. Morgan, you pay with your data. A lot of subscription models are out there. J .B.

**Changing Accessibility in Banking**
Morgan wants to tie into a Netflix subscription model. They want Here is another thing that is also a problem with the traditional bank. This is JP Morgan's offering software banking. You have to have $75 ,000 in your deposit account, or investment account, total investment assets, to access their private loan.

**Shifting Industry Norms**
They have lowered the bar. This is going to change the industry. In centrist, for all these services, you need a minimum of $100 ,000 in investment assets, or in some cases, $1 million or more in investment assets, the lower the bar.

**Embracing Innovation in Banking**
I think it is still flawed. If I am not having $75 ,000 with them, but I'm really a high -network guy, or a girl, you wouldn't know. So most of the industry is going with rules, not with an adaptive machine learning type approach to make, implement their strategies.

**Learning from Other Industries**
This is a challenge that I pose to my leadership in my group in consumer. What can we learn from other industries, right? So some of you think Google or Amazon can rule the world. I disagree. Here is why.

**Adapting Banking to Client-Centric Models**
If you look at pharma industry, right? If you look at the list of all these companies, these are huge companies, Johnson& Johnson, Roche, Pfizer, Novartis, Bay Area. All of them have more than 100 years of history.

**The Importance of Client Centricity**
They have weathered so much. They have weathered the Great Depression, world wars, they're still dominating the market, right? All these companies started with organic industry, aspirin, drugs like that.

**The Shift Towards Client-Centric Banking**
Then they migrated to microbiology, vaccines. insulin, antibiotics, and all that, right. And then, now they are like genomics. They have a core of research and development, right. That's their core. They're driven from one market discipline to another discipline, another knowledge discipline, another knowledge discipline, from organic industry to microbiology to genomics.

**Client Knowledge in Banking**
When it comes to banks, can you use the same template? I think it is, yes. In consumer bank, especially, is the knowledge about the client? If we go to village somewhere, the killer knows who is coming in.

**Differentiated Client Experience**
The baker comes in, the killer knows whether the baker has a working family they have. They keep going to school and all that. It's like a localized knowledge, right. The knowledge of the client. Is there a way to use that and treat the client differently?

**Transition from Intermediation to Access**
We need a differentiated client experience, regardless of how much you want. It's not like you have a $75 ,000, I'll treat you in one way, $100 ,000 million, I'll treat another way. That's old school.

**Banking's Historical Evolution**


That's not going to work. So if you use that kind of the same template, for centuries, banks really thrive on intermediation. Somebody wanted money. Somebody has excess money. Banks are in the ring. A colleague who owns capital markets.

**The Importance of Access in Modern Banking**
It's intermediation. Worked very well for centuries. Somebody in Columbia made a research and found out the capital market type theme. Remains of the 2% to 7% range for centuries. Like from 600 bucks from the rotation CEO company onwards.

**The Greatest Invention in Banking**
Very well. Then access makes you a big part. Do you know who said this? The greatest invention the banking has done in the past 50 or 60 years is APM. He was a chairman of the Fed. Things that I would never say that.

**The Future of Banking: Client-Centricity**
Paul Walker said that, which is true. The access to the money, 24 bits of that access to the money, then from intermediation to access. Today, it is client centricity. Anybody who can do well in client centricity can do really good.

**The Shift Towards Client-Centric Banking**
So what does client centricity actually mean? 90% of Americans live 20 miles from the nearest Walmart. 90%, right? When I go to Walmart, they're shaving cream. Shave my hand. Like socks, a T -shirt, or anything like that, right?

**Banking in the Digital Age**
Walmart treats me. as a way to push inventory out, clear inventory sales. Banks are very similar. They'll sell you a money market account, deposit account, credit cards, e -locks, mortgages, any of those sorts, right?

**Leveraging Data Analytics for Client Centricity**
If we go to Amazon .com, it's offline centric. My landing page is very different from yours. Very different from yours. It's offline centric. So the knowledge discipline that could take us into client centricity is machine learning and analytics, right?

**The Role of Data Analytics in Banking**
Here is another example of how this analytics can differentiate us to the market. You all take investment course. I'm going to give you a, this is the question. These companies, there are two different companies in here, Blue and Red, right?

**Insights from Predictive Modeling**
Both have very similar market cap, right? One has... And then from P -164, what companies are those? They are the same industry. Thank you, guys. Another clue here. Tesla and Ford. Tesla and Ford, very close.

**Adopting Innovative Technologies in Banking**
I mean, I like your thinking when you're going, but it's similar. Any guesses? Look at their voice. Number of people voice. Look at the P. There is some clue. Salesforce? Salesforce? Salesforce and something else.

**The Power of Predictive Analytics**
Close, but not quite right. I'll give you an example. They are an entertainment industry. Yeah, thank you. What is the network? There you go. Netflix and Walt Disney. So why would Netflix have this P .E.?

**Embracing Change in Banking Models**
That is Walt Disney is this much. I can't quite see it. What is it for Netflix, the P .E.? 148 versus, yeah. So we haven't gotten to P .E. yet in the course, but tell them first what that is so they know.

**Adapting Banking Strategies**
That's a multiple of the market rates. So market rates one to three times more from the earnings of Netflix versus 15 times more. If you look it up, it would be a very good thing. So if they earn $1 a year, there's $42.

**The Future of Banking Innovation**
And by the way, that's an outrageously large number. Outrageously large number, right? In any way, it's outrageously large number. How do you really substantiate something? Even if you give this recommendation, you come up with some numbers, run algorithms, go, and give this to Jeff or Bob.

**The Importance of Strategy in Banking**
even laugh at you. Why would you give this? That's a very make sense. To me it makes sense. Only one reason. Disney. Disney owns LucasDome, Disney owns Pixar, Disney owns Marvel. They have all these assets, massive assets.

**The Future of Banking: Client-Centricity**
How many of you are Disney fans? How many have Netflix accounts? Disney has all these assets, but when I go see a movie in a neighborhood A .M .T. theater, right? I'm an A .M .C. customer, not a Disney customer.

**Innovating with Client Data**
If a wife is ten years old, so whatever he calls him, so I find something which really suits him. So I find I find something, I get it. I'm a target client, or a Walmart client, by the way, by the toy.

**Leveraging Client Data for Competitive Advantage**
Disney has lost the sight of their client. They accumulate the assets. They don't have my incentive. They cannot use machine learning and analytics like Netflix does. Netflix has all the right walks.

**The Transformation of Netflix**
They know what to watch, what to don't watch, how much we pause, how much we repeat, all that, right? What is the use of all that? Netflix was a DVD mailing company not long before. And you were like kids.

**The Power of Adaptation in Business**
So it wasn't that good. Then when there's like, they've worked at themselves and went for streaming. And now they have 10% of Hollywood production. From zero 10 years back to almost 10% of the Hollywood production.

**The Future of Banking with Analytics**
That comes with clients. They will produce something and put out there the confidence that Hollywood cannot do. Hollywood economics is like a term, you must record, right? You put something out there and pay for it for Netflix.

**Client-Centricity as a Key Theme in Banking**
Many companies push products like the Hollywood economics. They'll come up with some kind of business plan of sort, which is essentially Hollywood economics. Not Netflix, it doesn't have to. So client -centricity is a theme for some firms and many other banks.

**Embracing Analytics for Client Engagement**
And the more we do, the better we do on client -centricity, I think we are going to win. My bank is going to be very different from my bank. And the bank of the future is going to use analytics. It's going to use machine learning much more in an effective way that could keep clients in this city.

**Utilizing Data for Personalized Banking**
And I walk in or take my mobile app and launch my app. The bank would know me much better, just like the village, 20 years of experience, knowledge, the community, that was knowledge to be packed. And the only way we could pack that is through our exclamation point, right?

**Innovative Technologies in Banking: A Video Demonstration**
stop. I wanted to show something real quick, a couple of minutes of video. How many of you have heard a company

 called DataRobot? A few of those, right? So the reason I'm going to play this is you're going to learn a lot about machine learning and how to do machine learning, or the period of time you can take a little bit.

**Introduction to DataRobot**
Controversial thing, I'm going to say. Because artificial intelligence is going to automate many of those, right? So this is a company I visited like a year back. Fascinated, we're going to do some experiments with them.

**Automating Predictive Modeling**
I'll play this on the top of my head. DataRobot is an automated machine learning platform that helps you solve business problems by finding the best predictive model for your data. And an incredibly clean interface allows analysts, developers, and data professionals to rapidly build highly accurate predictive models, embedding the best practices of the world's top data scientists into every model they build.

**Efficiency in Machine Learning with DataRobot**
Massively parallel processing allows users to build many models at once, so the work that used to take weeks now happens in an afternoon. Instead of guessing which model will work for any given data set, DataRobot systematically compares models built with Python's scikit -learn, R, Spark, H2O, Valpal Web, TensorFlow, and others.

**The Future of Data Analytics**
Models are described with incredible transparency, and DataRobot uses novel techniques to extract deep insights from each and every one. No, you can't use this for your homework. You must commit by generating a simply elegant one -line API code at the touch of a body.

**Transforming Data Analytics with DataRobot**
With DataRobot, you can deliver predictive analytics and insights to your business in hours instead of months. DataRobot, the world's most advanced machine learning platform for accurate predictive modeling made easy, fast, and powerful.

**Wisdom in Action**
So there's a saying, with all the getting and getting understanding, a lot of wisdom to it. Jeff talked about the data sets, aggregating all those data sets and making sense, like in a way that people influence people with clear logic, it will be worth much more than working on techniques.

**Building the Cathedral**
There is a story from, you must have heard this, the monk is passing through a village, and he sees a couple of folks stacking stones at the outskirts of the village. So he's asking one of them, hey, what are you doing?

**Fulfillment in Career**
He says, Oh, can't you see, I'm just stacking stones. So he passes 10 meters, 20 meters, there's this other guy carrying the stones, and he's asking the same question. Hey, what are you doing? The other guy says, oh, you're building this beautiful cathedral.

**Banking in the Digital Age**
This is going to be the biggest church in the village. And he gives live information about it. Machine learning analytics is like stacking stones. Right? What you do with it is much more important than how you do it.

**Differentiation in the Marketplace**
So if you are looking for a very, you are all very bright, I think the thing that would differentiate you in the marketplace and give you a lot of fulfillment in your career is then build the cathedral.

**Looking Ahead in Banking**
And I know you all do it. That's all. Thank you. So, I am banking with JP Morgan because it has presence everywhere even though I am in Atlanta right now, I go to more, I go to different states and I want my, I want my bank to a bank at least.

**Adapting to Technological Change**
So, how do you think SunTrust will be able to compete with that in future? So, tomorrow there will be mobile banking because of that the presence of the bank whether there is a branch or ATM in there won't really matter or do you think expanding branches in various locations will be more helpful?

**The Future of Banking**
The question is I want to bank with a bank which has presence in all states not with the regional bank which is localized. What do you think tomorrow is going to be? So, tomorrow the definition of bank will change.

**Evolution of Banking**
Do you think probably of branches and scientists? You probably think of mobile app tomorrow. There are a lot of, how many of you are from Europe? Do you bank with N26? Monzo, any of the internet only banks?

**Adapting to Technological Trends**
It's catching up real, real quick. So, the notion of what banking will change and you will be able to identify with an entity that would manage or finance this in a very different way but just with technology rather than physical structure.

**The Essential Role of Banking**
That's my question. Any other questions? Yes. You highlighted the resilience of these companies and I wonder if you see if that's because that product that they're creating is more essential, where it's perceived to be.

**Banking as a Fundamental Service**
You see banking in a perceived similarly, an essential thing, or does that allow some flexibility in how fast you catch up with technology trends? So the question is, we talked about banking and pharma and financial services.

**The Future of Financial Services**
Pharma is very essential if you don't take it or drive it by. So financial services, can you equate or what is the relationship, right? Is it the same? How many of you want to have a life that is out of poverty?

**Enabling Progress through Financial Services**
How many of you don't want to suffer from poverty? How many of you want to buy a car? How many of you want to buy your dinner tonight? So when you think of bank, you don't think of all these. Essentially, financial services enables this and much more.

**Banking in the Future**
It's fundamental to a society that wants to make progress. Whether the bank of today can do this well, it's a test for tomorrow. The bank of the future is going to do it much, much better then. And we want to be the bank of the future.

**The Speaker's Vision**
By the way, just like Bob's team is hiding, my team is hiding. That's me. Thank you.
