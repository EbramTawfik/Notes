# Is the stock market rigged?

## Introduction

This month marks the fifth anniversary of the current bull market on Wall Street, making it one of the longest and strongest in history. Yet, US stock ownership is at a record low. In less than half of Americans trust banks and financial services.

## Investigations

In the last two weeks, the New York Attorney General and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission in Washington have both launched investigations into the high-frequency computerized stock trading that now controls more than half the market. The probes were announced just ahead of a much-anticipated book on the subject by best-selling author Michael Lewis called Flash Boys.

## Flash Boys

In it, Lewis argues that the stock market is now rigged to benefit a group of insiders that have made tens of billions of dollars exploiting computerized trading. The story is told through an unlikely cast of characters who figured out what was going on and devised a plan to correct it. It could have a huge impact on Wall Street tonight. Michael Lewis talks about it for the first time. The story will continue in a moment.

## Conclusion

What's the headline here? Stock markets rigged. The United States stock market, the most iconic market in global capitalism, is rigged by whom? By a combination of the stock exchanges, the big Wall Street banks, and high-frequency traders. Who are the victims? Everybody who has an investment in the stock market.


## The Real Stock Market

Michael Lewis isn't talking about the stock market that you see on television every day, that seems to be the center of US financial activity. This stock market exists today mostly as a photo op.

## The Hidden Market

The stock market that Lewis is talking about is the one where most of the trades take place now, inside hundreds of thousands of these black boxes located at more than 60 public and private exchanges. Here, billions of dollars in stock change hands every day with little or no public documentation.

## The Role of Computers

Trades are being made by thousands of robot computers programmed to buy and sell every stock on the market at speeds a hundred times faster than you can blink an eye. This system is so complex it's all but invisible.

## The Complexity

If it wasn't complicated, it wouldn't be allowed to happen. The complexity disguises what is happening. If it's so complicated you can't understand it, then you can't question it.

## The Removal of Humans

This is all being done by computers. It's too fast to be done by humans. Humans have been completely removed from the marketplace.

## Speed and Trading

Fast is the operative word. Machines with secret programs are now trading stocks in tiny fractions of a second, way too fast to be seen or recorded on a stock ticker or computer screen. This is faster than the market itself.

## High-Frequency Traders

High-frequency traders, big Wall Street firms, and stock exchanges have spent billions to gain an advantage of a millisecond for themselves and their customers. They do this just to get a peek at stock market prices and orders a flash before everyone else.

## Front Running

Along with the opportunity to act on the inside, they are able to move faster than you. They're able to see your order and play it against other orders in ways you don't understand. They are able to front run your order. This means they're able to identify your desire to buy shares in Microsoft, for example, and buy them in front of you and sell them back to you at a higher price.

## The Impact

It all happens in infinitesimally small periods of time. The speed advantage that the faster traders have is milliseconds, some of those fractions of milliseconds. But it's enough for them to identify what you're going to do and do it before you do it, at your expense. So, it drives the price up, and in turn, you pay a higher price.


## Michael Lewis and Brad Katsuyama

Michael Lewis is not the first person to allege the stock market is rigged or that high-frequency traders are front-running the market. However, he was the first to find Brad Katsuyama, a trader at the Royal Bank of Canada. Katsuyama was the first to figure out how it was being done.

## Katsuyama's Discovery

Brad Katsuyama, a young Canadian man, realized that the market that he thought he knew had changed. The market seemed to be willing to sell off stock, but the minute he went to buy it, someone else bought it. The stock went up. It seemed like someone knew what he was doing before he did it.

## Katsuyama's Experience

Back in 2008, Katsuyama was 30 years old and running the Royal Bank of Canada's stock desk in New York with 25 traders working for him. Every time one of them tried to buy a large block of stock for a client, their order would only be partially filled, and the price of the stock would go up. This kept happening over and over again.

## The Concert Ticket Analogy

The best analogy is that your family wants to go to a concert. There are four tickets all next to each other for 20 bucks each. You put in an order to buy four tickets at 20 bucks each, and it says you bought two tickets at 20 bucks each. When you go back, those same two seats that are sitting there have now gone up to $25.

## The Problem

At first, Katsuyama had no idea what the problem was. He thought it must be that the technology at RBC was slow. However, when he visited one of the largest hedge funds in the world in Stamford, Connecticut, he realized that the same thing he was experiencing as a trader was also happening to the most sophisticated hedge fund in the world. This realization made him say, "Holy cow, this is a huge problem."

## The Motivation

Katsuyama was determined to get to the bottom of it because it didn't feel right. It didn't feel right that people who are investing on behalf of pension funds and retirement funds are getting bait-and-switched every single day in the market.


## The Problem and the Team

Katsuyama suspected that the problem had something to do with the way the trades were routed through fiber-optic cables from his trading desk in lower Manhattan to the 13 public exchanges in northern New Jersey. However, no one would tell him exactly what happened to his orders once he hit the buy or sell button. So, he put together a team of technical experts, traders, and most importantly, an Irish telecom guy named Ronan Ryan, who was an expert on high-speed fiber-optic networks.

## Ronan Ryan's Expertise

Ryan had done work for the high-frequency traders. He knew what they were building and he knew about the colossal amounts of money they were prepared to spend. He told Brad about a company called Spread Networks that had laid a high-speed fiber-optic cable from the futures market in Chicago to the exchanges in New Jersey.

## The Investment in Speed

Spread Networks spent 300 million dollars just to shave 3 milliseconds off the fastest route, releasing access to high-frequency traders at 10 million dollars a pop. From Brad Katsuyama's point of view, when he heard they were willing to spend that kind of money for milliseconds, it told him that the sums involved were vast.

## The Realization

That was one of the first questions he had: "Alright, I'm getting ripped off. Everybody's getting ripped off. But what does it add up to?" When he heard the story of Spread Networks, he realized we're talking about tens of billions of dollars.


## The Role of Ronan Ryan

Ronan Ryan knew where all the cable was buried and had detailed maps of the fastest routes from the financial district in lower Manhattan to the various stock exchanges in New Jersey, all calculated down to the millisecond. He would roll out maps and draw the data center as a box with a line going to it.

## The Discovery

Ryan asked his colleagues if they were aware of where these data centers were located and that they were arriving there at different time intervals. For Brad, the maps turned what had been an abstract idea into something he could actually see. The first places orders were landing was the BATS Exchange across the river in Weehawken, New Jersey, and high-frequency traders were lying there in wait.

## The Front-Running

Brad realized that he was being front-run because his signal gets to the BATS Exchange first and they can beat him to all the other exchanges.


Sure, here is the organized transcript with headers related to the content of each paragraph:

## High Speed Traders
It only took a tiny fraction of a second for Brad's trade to reach the next exchanges on the network but the high speed traders were able to jump in front of him buy the same stock and drive the price up before his order arrived.

## Impact of Small Profits
Producing a small profit of just one or two pennies but it was happening to everyone's trades millions of times a day that adds up you make it sound like a skim what else would you call it.

## Hedge Fund Manager's Perspective
One hedge fund manager said I was running our hedge fund there was nine billion dollars and that we figured that just our inability to make the trades the market said we should be able to make was costing us three hundred million dollars a year.

## Question of Legality
That was 300 million dollars a year in someone else's pocket is this illegal no that's the thing that's so shocking about all this well you use the word front running.

## Legalized Front Running
Front running is illegal this formal front running is legal it's legalized front running it is crazy that it's legal for some people to get advanced news on prices and of other of what investors are doing it's just nuts shouldn't happen.

## Strategy to Beat High-Frequency Traders
Ronen knew the only way to beat the high-frequency traders was to take away their milliseconds advantage that allowed them to sniff out slower trades and beat them to the exchange. He had an idea how to do it and he said you're probably better off trying to go slower. Which means send the order to the exchange located at farthest away first and send the order to the one that's located closest you last so stagger when you send them out with the goal of arriving at all places as close to the same time as possible.

## Implementation of the Strategy
Matsuyama and his team develop software that did just that allowing the orders of Royal Bank of Canada's customers to reach all of the exchanges at the same time cutting the high-frequency traders out of the equation and essentially our fill rates went to a hundred percent we can believe it when we actually figured it out.

## Beating Speed by Slowing Down
So you beat speed by slowing it down. Yeah, it's crazy as that sounds.


Sure, here is the organized transcript with headers related to the content of each paragraph:

## Spreading Awareness
Katsuyama and his team went out and began selling and explaining what they had discovered. The big mutual funds, pension funds, and institutional investors, people who had had suspicions that they were being front-run but didn't know how, and nobody had really bothered or tried to figure this out until Brad Katsuyama came along.

## Investor Reactions
It was in nobody's interest to correct it. He spoke to dozens of investors, big investors, famous investors who said that when Brad Katsuyama came into their office and laid out to them how the market was rigged, their jaws hit the floor. They knew something was wrong, they just didn't know what it was and no one had told them.

## Realization
Part of those meetings led them to believe, "Holy cow, this is really something," because some of the most sophisticated, largest asset managers in the world, this was the first time they were hearing this story.


Sure, here is the organized transcript with headers related to the content of each paragraph:

## Engagement with Famous Names in the American Stock Market
Some of the most famous names in the American stock market heard the pitch. The Capital Group, T. Rowe Price, Fidelity, Vanguard, one after another, he was in their offices. They said, "This man walked in, why is he going to know how the stock market operates?" And at the end of an hour, they said, "Oh my God, he understands."

## David Einhorn's Belief and Understanding
Hedge fund titan David Einhorn of Green Light Capital is one of the believers. Was he able to show you how your orders were being front run? "Oh yeah, they had a marker and the whiteboard and started drawing maps and boxes and wires and locations and yeah, we went through it in some detail. It was interesting."

## Encouragement to Do Something Bigger
It was clients like Einhorn who encouraged Brad and his team to do something bigger. That's when Katsuyama, a conformist even by Canadian standards, decided to do something radical.

Sure, here is the organized transcript with headers related to the content of each paragraph:

## Decision to Quit and Start a New Venture
In 2012, he quit his high paying job as head trader at RBC and went off with some of his team to start their own exchange. You were making good money at the Royal Bank of Canada, right? Millions of dollars, all right. Yes, I guess everyone knows that now, right? Right, yeah. Why did you want to go off and walk away from that job and start a stock exchange? Yeah, it wasn't an easy conversation with my wife, that's for sure.

## Sense of Obligation
It almost felt like a sense of obligation to say we found a problem. It's affecting millions and millions and millions of people. People are blindly losing money they didn't know they're entitled to. It's just a hole in the bottom of the bucket.

## Building the Investors Exchange (IEX)
They set out to build an exchange funded exclusively by large traditional investors. They called it IEX, the Investors Exchange, and quietly launched it in October with the support of some of the biggest players on Wall Street. And it comes with built-in speed bumps to eliminate the advantage of high-speed predators.

## The Magic Shoe Box
And the way they did it was with a coiled 60 kilometers of fiber optic cable between themselves and the high-frequency traders' computers. So it's called the magic shoe box. It's a box and it looks like it's got fishing line in it. But essentially, a high-frequency trader, if he tries to react on the IEX exchange, his trade goes through for 60 kilometers himself. So he's using these to ensure it gets there at the same time as everybody else's.


Sure, here is the organized transcript with headers related to the content of each paragraph:

## Anticipating High-Frequency Traders
You think that they can game you? I think that they'll try to game us. I think the fact though that we've gone and met with the majority of the biggest high-frequency firms to explain what the magic shoe box is doing and that people haven't said, "Oh, that's rubbish, that won't work." We've had many ask us for a backdoor, to be honest. So that says something, that it will work.

## Strong Start of the Exchange
We're up to 38 and a half million shares. The exchange is off to a strong start, although it is still very small with lots of powerful enemies that like the status quo and are trying to starve IEX by discouraging customers from using them. Green Light Capital's David Einhorn is one of the investors. Do you think IEX will survive? I think it's going to succeed. I think it's going to succeed in a very big way.

## Endorsement from Goldman Sachs
Just last week, IEX received a strong endorsement from Goldman Sachs, whose top executives cited it as a model for a more stable and less complicated stock market.

## Selling Trust and Transparency
We're selling trust. We're selling transparency. And to think today, to think that trust is actually a differentiator in a service business, it's kind of a crazy thought, right? Why is this kid, why is he able to all of a sudden sit at the center of the American stock market? The answer is, when someone walks in the door who is actually trustworthy, he has enormous power. And this is the story, the story of trying to restore trust to the financial markets.
